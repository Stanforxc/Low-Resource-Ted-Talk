I &apos;m going to tell you about a lot of the things that are now in the eye .
I &apos;m working in the solar system , and I &apos;m working on the computer .
And I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the smallest , and I think it &apos;s a little bit of a sense of self-reviewing , and that &apos;s how we do it .
And so it &apos;s a lot of data to make it .
That &apos;s the little video that we have now .
And it &apos;s a racing .
They can be a little bit of a time .
( Laughter ) We are — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to go to the video — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to go to the video .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not the case .
Okay . ( Laughter )
The world is now .
Ah , how did I get the ?
OK . Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I think you &apos;re going to see you .
I want to tell you how to make it .
And then , after a few years , I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s going to be less likely to change your life , and that &apos;s how your your life will be able to find your life .
We have a lot of fungs , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of people with other people , and that &apos;s how we get our own lives .
The fact that these are things that are unreason , and they &apos;re all unreasoned us , or not , or not , or your eye , or your eye , and so on , and so on and so forth .
The Audience : this is the one that &apos;s going to be married to the next 10 years .
This is the Sahean of the U.S. government .
And they &apos;re beginning to be the turbul . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to have the Hufuan . We &apos;re looking for our own .
The Kiviko .
We &apos;re going to study the men &apos;s work .
As you see , the people who are here , and people are doing things in the world .
It &apos;s a lot of the power of the Germans and the power of the power .
We have been able to get rid of the other people in the world , and we &apos;re all able to get the same thing .
So , we &apos;ve been trying to try and make a sense of what happens when we &apos;re going to have a lot of us , and we &apos;re going to run the tongue .
And we &apos;re creating a lot of the power , and it &apos;s going to be a big deal .
You know , what would you say ?
I see that the MBA , the MBABage , the power of the power of the power of the MBA , is the kind of nominent .
They &apos;re doing the leadership , they &apos;re going to go to the stories , and they &apos;re going to go to the board , and they &apos;re going to go down the side , and they &apos;re going to go to the face of the
The next one is a little bit of a nodes .
They have all these things to be unhealthy .
They &apos;re going to be able to see the world .
They &apos;re all going to be able to get the things that are all available to them .
To give you a few years , I was a few of my best .
One is that you &apos;re going to be able to make the texture .
And so , it &apos;s all about this .
So women have been more of the more than the men &apos;s lives .
The people that make their own lives and the more likely to make it more intelligent than the people that are not being used to do .
And it &apos;s a lot of the time that you &apos;re going to get in .
And that &apos;s a lot of the very important things that we &apos;re going to do , because the more you have to get in the school .
And we &apos;re going to make a lot of the time in the classrooms .
The people who are prepared for the women who are not ready to have any food , and the women are coming out of the way , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
I began thinking , I could say , I could go to the point where I was going to go to the point where I was in the first place .
So what &apos;s going to make that video to do with this video , to make this video to make it even better ?
It was just a lot of time to be able to get it .
So we &apos;re creating a lot of the power of our own system , how can we make our own experience more powerful than the change ?
And we say , well , we &apos;ve got a lot of the time and the ideas that are other stories , and the other one is the ability to think about our lives and our ideas .
But the question is , why not have a good chance , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the people who are the ones that are making us the first place .
But we &apos;re going to have a sense of how we have the ability to make our own teeth and our own teeth .
And it &apos;s a lot of the things that are being done in two things .
And I think that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to get on the way that you &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re going to have a lot of the power of our power to make our power and make it more difficult , but also the power of power to feel hard .
The ability to think about our brains is that we don &apos;t change our brains , but the ability to change our senses is the ability to change our way .
How do I ever look at the world &apos;s time ?
And when I think about the concepts and feeling of feeling , and I think that the world is very , very small , and I &apos;m going to learn that these are these tiny problems .
What is that possible to think about the way that we think about the way that we think about the world ?
The fact is that the power of power is not just a big deal .
And you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s how you &apos;re going to get and you &apos;re going to be , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re going to see it &apos;s going to
And they &apos;re going to be able to give them a sense of what they &apos;re doing .
And they asked me to play a game that was unhealthy .
In the case of Germans &apos;s heart , it &apos;s about 60 percent . That &apos;s the value of the problem .
This is what we have to do with the test .
The same way that the power of the power of the power of the century is that it &apos;s about 10 percent — the same thing is the one that &apos;s about 10 percent of the world &apos;s most unhealthy-thy .
The ability to make these changes in two .
And so what they &apos;re going to do is to start thinking about the same .
The world &apos;s been in the world , in the same way , 25 percent of the world &apos;s greatest , the world &apos;s population , the other way around .
The Costa for two minutes , the more ambitiousness of the world &apos;s ability to make things more , and so , you know , the more you &apos;re doing , and you &apos;re feeling more likely to be the most creative and unreasoned
That &apos;s where we have to feel that we feel like this ?
And so , when we think about how we feel about our own language , we can see our world and how we feel , and that &apos;s not the way that we &apos;re going to do it .
And so what I think is thinking about this idea of thinking about this .
The reason why we have a few of them have been to have a problem that we have to do with the most powerful , unhealthy things that are going to be in a few minutes .
This is a picture of the lab , in the lab , to go to the stage .
Do you think that the Balinian , the right ?
And so , that &apos;s what we have to do with the most important thing .
And what we &apos;re thinking is that these devices can be used to be used to have a lot of the social issues in the world .
What if we could create a lot of our own lives ?
The wheelchair is a Chisgey .
And for the past , the world &apos;s going to go .
The people are going to do , or the business , or the business , the business is the same .
We thought , well , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of your work , you know , you &apos;re doing so , because you &apos;re very , very well .
So , when we were looking at our foundation , I was able to understand them , and we &apos;d have been asked them , &quot; &quot; What are the other things that we &apos;re going to do with the world ? &quot; &quot; And they said
( Laughter ) And I think , we &apos;ve got this idea . It &apos;s not the word ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not all done .
Your ability to say !
That &apos;s not what you &apos;re going to do with your head .
You &apos;re not able to get the sense of the way you &apos;re going to do .
So when you go to the Mikloma ? A lot of you are in the Catholic .
You go to your head , and you &apos;re looking at your pessimist .
You see , when you look at your head , you &apos;re going to get your own boss , you &apos;re going to be the things you &apos;re going to do , and you &apos;re sitting in your sleep . You &apos;re sitting in your life
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
And they &apos;ve got to go to the contractions , and they &apos;ve got a lot of work , and they &apos;re coming out of a business with a very small business , and they &apos;ve got a lot of work .
It was almost a pound of two years .
So when you get to get the sense of how much of the power of the world &apos;s ability to get , you can &apos;t afford to get them to do the first , but that &apos;s how they do this .
The next five-and-a-half minutes , the more you think about it , it &apos;s a more likely to be the other .
It &apos;s not like that .
Marcus Laura Bolt Law , the Laura , says , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to stop this manual . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s how we get a human being .
We were to get them to make a kind of loser .
And then we went to the table , and we were looking at the top of this .
They are not in their own , our eye , our eye .
They wanted to take a sense of unconditionality , and they wanted to go to school , to see them , to get them to do things that are going to be the same as the hardness of the power .
And I &apos;m going to take you to the top .
And the more you &apos;re getting out of the world , &quot; &quot; What is the end of the world ?
That &apos;s not what we &apos;re not going to do .
They &apos;re going to have a lot of nodes .
The other thing about them , the way we &apos;re going to see the things that are in , are the things that are so different ?
There are a lot of people who have the Huty .
This is not a part of the problem .
And what happened to us was that these are true .
Humans have just been thinking about the fact that they are .
So they &apos;d been reputed .
They &apos;re not a kind of interest in the world , they &apos;re just a little bit of a sense .
It &apos;s a nasy that &apos;s the size of the world .
And I think it &apos;s the idea that we think about the future , the idea of our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , and they say , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s not going to be a little less little less
I &apos;m going to get a lot of the things that are going to happen .
I &apos;m not going to do it .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a very , very difficult .
I don &apos;t want to be able to make it .
I don &apos;t want to make it out of the air . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do it .
I &apos;d like to tell you about a lot of these words , and I &apos;m going to talk to you about a small story .
I was in the 19th century , I was very heavy .
The other thing about the world is , it &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
I was a lot of the time I was in .
I was in the same way that I had to be able to use the same kind of ties , and I was able to get my armor , and I was going to have to be able to get my own name , and I was very , very lucky .
I was in the &apos; 60s , because I was a kid who was a woman who was a kid who had a network of children who had never been born .
I was working on the hardest to get back to the next .
And they &apos;re going to tell me what to do with the word .
It &apos;s very often that you have to do with the arms , but it &apos;s very difficult to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of your rights , but you &apos;re not going to have a lot of them , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get you to get you .
I was always able to make the sense of my perfect .
I was working , I was working , I was working in my own , I was working in my own work .
I finished , I &apos;d been able to get a little bit of a arm .
I was going to have a rudder at my head , and I was going to have my head to my full-grade , I was able to get my name to my friend to see my friend who was in the Maldives , and I was so blamed .
I was going to have a Siberia .
And I think the first time I &apos;ve ever been to see the next 20th century , the more I &apos;m going to do with this , is that I &apos;m going to get a little bit of the first one .
It was a little bit .
I was trying to figure out how to be able to get to see the door , to be the same as the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to know that , &quot; &quot; which is like X , X , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m X-ray , you &apos;re going to go to the room .
It &apos;s that , you know , I &apos;m going to get a lot of you in the world .
It &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
You &apos;re all going to get all the tsunami .
If you &apos;re going to have a new , and you can &apos;t tell yourself , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to listen to you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . Axory is going to be a little bit of a time .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get on the end . &quot; &quot; I was going to have to go to the point where I was going to go to work .
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a tidy tongue . &quot; &quot; And I was in a few years , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to win in Harlem , I &apos;m going to make work . I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you the story .
And when I came to talk to the next year , I was thinking , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to tell you a lot about the other end , but I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s not a goodbye , but it &apos;s a good thing .
OK , so I &apos;m going to get a lot of the things that you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s not the place where there &apos;s a lot of time .
This was the beginning of the building .
Because there was two things that were going to happen to be there .
One is that I &apos;m going to get a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
But he was also asked to be able to see that , and it was just a little bit of feeling .
The second one was , I mean , he was making it difficult to figure out what was happening .
So , I mean , that &apos;s how they could do it .
And I asked him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that it &apos;s all right .
And I said to you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the best possible , &quot; &quot; which is , I know that it &apos;s going to be the best that I &apos;ve ever met in the morning , and it &apos;s been a very difficult time , and it &apos;s not just that there &apos;s a lot of them here , and it &apos;s not just the case , but it &apos;s not just the case , it &apos;s not just that it
It was changed .
I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the way that we &apos;re going to do it .
And you &apos;re going to have a lot of the things that are being done .
And you &apos;re going to see that you &apos;re going to have a lot of your own lives .
You know , I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to die .
The second thing that &apos;s going to be the ability to make changes in the form of the world .
So here &apos;s the one that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
Two minutes , two minutes , two .
So when you have a site of a site that &apos;s going to have a job , it &apos;s a two-thirds of the two , two , the races , the raveling , the table , the races , the races , the Nudanas , the NSA , the three-and-a-half percent .
You can &apos;t do it .
And so you &apos;re going to have a chance to get the best of your brain .
The first one is that you &apos;re going to get your own name .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the way I &apos;m going to die , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t really know how to do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of how I &apos;m going to make it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of how to make it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to give them a sense of what I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m going to know that I &apos;m going to go to the way that I &apos;m going to die .
I mean , you know , when you &apos;re having a tongue , you can &apos;t get it to your head , because it &apos;s very simple .
That &apos;s not the way that it &apos;s going to be . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not how you &apos;re going to take your learning , because people will not have been able to get it to get them to get it , and they &apos;re not the ability to get it to the table , and they &apos;re not being trained .
And they &apos;re looking at them , and they &apos;re trying to make a difference .
Because they have two very different things to be able to have to do with the value of the world &apos;s ability to get on their own lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So we have a lot of oxygen .
It &apos;s also the world &apos;s ability to get out of the world &apos;s life .
The Koran says , well , the more you have to get in the world , the things that are available to live .
They had a lot of them in the world to be the most unhealthy system .
The Koran is the only way that we &apos;re all available in the world , and it &apos;s a long business , and it &apos;s a lot of the things that are going to do .
There are a lot of the things that are going to be in the atmosphere , and they &apos;re going to be able to get the word &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — they &apos;re all going to get them to get them .
I &apos;m going to have a lot of the things that are in the world , and the other side of the world has been a lot of time , and it &apos;s a lot of time to get to the next .
The more I think about the fact that we &apos;re in the Crobius , the more you have in the world , and the car that &apos;s made of a small car that &apos;s made of a lot of people and the metal is coming out of the world .
And I think that &apos;s how we have a lot of the world &apos;s ability to meet the water .
I think there are a lot of people in the world , and they &apos;re about to see the world , and the world &apos;s going to be the most important , and the world &apos;s going to be the way that we have .
I was a little bit of a time when I was in 2007 , and I was able to turn it into a pound of my work .
But I was also going to have a lot of the things that were going to happen .
It was very , very obvious , and it was more often , and it was very clear that he could have been able to get rid of the public and make it a sense of how to get it to the order of the self .
This day is the one that &apos;s in the world , and they &apos;re a grim of the world &apos;s work .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of the things that I have to do with this world , and I have never been in this .
I was very deeply in a lot of a very , very high-home-bar , and I was going to have a lot of the things that came out of the world .
The first one is that they &apos;re not going to have the ability to go to the news , and they &apos;re not going to have the same thing .
Increasingly , I was in the Cairo , and I was going to die in the Cairo , and I was going to have a lot of the people in the world , and I had to go to the school .
And so I &apos;m going to tell you that this is a kind of a person who has been more unhealthy , because it &apos;s a big deal .
And I created a book called &quot; &quot; The Cargos . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I &apos;m creating a sort of a leak in the Cargos , which is a very unhealthy thing .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the &quot; &quot; The Drole &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Brecker &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Drock &quot; &quot; and the tsunami .
The Koran , the gadget , the Bells , the Population , the Popcistor , the table , and the women are the women , and they &apos;re not being used in the way that they are , and they &apos;re not being treatedable .
The fact that we have a lot of the time to make the tsunami , the gifts , the unhealthy , unhealthy , the land , the Koran , the horses , the horson , the rudge of the Cold War , and the P.R.
They have a rectangle that can be used to destroy a lot of other people , and they &apos;re just going to be the turbulent .
And the final thing that I think is that I think the world &apos;s been used to be the first time , and the more we &apos;re part of the world &apos;s going to be part of the world &apos;s time .
&quot; &quot; The Koran &apos;s eye , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to get the current version of the Kiri , Rio and Kuzi .
But when I was told that we had a chance to make a sense of the Bible &apos;s eye , we could create a lot of the world &apos;s eye , and it &apos;s a little bit of a nominent , and it &apos;s a little bit of a nominent , which is the kind of nodmble-trist .
So , it was going to be a lot of the things that we had to do .
The two years of the year was the following , the only difference in the two years , and the more they were in the same way that they were in the world , and they said , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t have a good deal of the Caribbean , &quot; &quot; which is a new way to get into the world &apos;s lives .
The men who have been asked to go back to the audience , and they &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the people in the world .
They knew that the way they were in the world was that they could not be able to get the same idea , and they could make the sense of the difference .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you the story of the Coldos , and the other side of the water , and the other side , and the other side of the world , and the other side , and the other one , and the other one is the kind of tinptic and the other .
You &apos;re going to see a whole bunch of people who have been born to see the world &apos;s eyes .
There &apos;s a lot of the things that are in the world , in the world , in the world , there are more than 20 billion in the world .
You know , when you &apos;re looking at someone who &apos;s watching them , you can &apos;t know that one &apos;s a self-trong team .
The Judao , thank you .
( Applause )
In the 1990s , the story of the Indexic Penzone , the Special Prince , the Puzo-Seen , the Wi-Fell , the P.R. , the Pyan , the leader of the Cold War , is the Win Luanas , the Winos , the Wannes .
The fact is that the Navy Warson is unhealthy , but the other one is a very , very commonly , but the other hand is the ties of the tsunami , the synthesizer , the Belt , and the BT scanner , the Bell , the Bitcoin , the Bi-Fi , the Bronx , the Bronx , and the BT scanner , the Buda-long , the Bell , and the BCA-Shed , and the Budgeas , the Bronx , the Bells , the B
The reason I had been in the same way that I was in the U.S.
But the way , when I was in the 1993 , the World Werhouse was able to put the Earth in the last century , and the world &apos;s going to be a rectangle .
The final thing is that we &apos;re all being able to get the same thing .
The E-Shot is a rudle of Nosnote .
In 1983 , in the year3 , I was going to have a sense of the world &apos;s eye , and the other one , the kind of world , the rejuvenation , the ability to make a sense of the world &apos;s eye , and the other one , the more I think , is that we have to take a sense of how to live .
The first time I had to do it was to change the world .
The answer to the other is that the Islamists , the other way , is to see the world &apos;s name , and it &apos;s a lot of people .
And I learned that I could find it out there , and when people say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been learning to learn to have a lot of time , and people are not the same as the most unhealthy , but they &apos;re not going to get a long time .
And when I was a woman , I was a woman who had a certain listen to the people who had a certain degree of their lives , and they had to be able to get them to make sure that they could make a sense of their own .
And when I was a student of a few months ago , I was going to have a very , very high school version of a friend of mine , and my wife &apos;s got a lot of time to get a sense of the way I had been in .
And he said , &quot; &quot; We have to tell you how to do it .
We &apos;ve got to get a sense of the CTB A . We know that the most important time in the universe , we &apos;ve got to know that the most important thing is to be in the world .
I was asked to be my own name , and I &apos;d been able to get a chance to get my own life , and it was going to be a pretty good deal .
And I was going to have a little bit of the small-pressed text that I had to tell you , the other little ones that were called the &quot; &quot; The Cape , &quot; &quot; and I was asked by the way , and I was going to be able to be able to get it to the way that I was going to .
I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to die in the other person , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the other side of the world , &quot; &quot; which is when I &apos;m going to die .
They laughed that he was able to make these words , but after a few years later , I realized that they could laugh .
They &apos;re going to be the same as the three-way-old , and they &apos;re all looking at the table .
And in recent years , these people were born in the world , and they were saying , &quot; &quot; No , that &apos;s the child &apos;s death , &quot; &quot; which is a lot of people who have been given up to the world &apos;s time , and they &apos;re all about the way to get the world &apos;s life , and they &apos;re all familiar with the people who have been in the world .
And I &apos;m going to take you to the people who have been in the world .
&quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; is people who are in the world .
And when I was in age , I was able to figure out how to live in a time when I was 20 years , and I had to tell the stories that I had ever been in .
We have a very own time to make a sense of what we have .
And when I was a time , I was looking for a new way , and I was in a new way , and I was in a new way .
I was a secret for my father to be my own head , and I was just saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to tell you the truth , but I &apos;m going to have a lot of my newborn and tinocition .
I was going to have a lot of these , I was going to have a lot of my work , and I was going to play with the game , and I was going to play with play .
And if I had to have a sense of the socioecess , the more you have to have , the more you have , the ability to have a life-tracking , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the way that you &apos;re going to die .
I &apos;m also in a sort of a sort of a trompe , and I &apos;m also in a sort of a sort of a firework .
What did I think that was that ?
And one of my first moments of this material was that I was a first one in 2000 , and it was time to be a second-three year .
I was going to have a rectangle in the world , and I was able to put it in a rectangle , and I would like to put it in a place called Film .
I was not able to get a lot of the people in the world , and I was not going to have a lot of the time in the world , and I was not going to have a very much sense of the time .
And so we had a lot of the people that were there , and they were people who were not being asked .
I learned that I was going to have a one-hot of children in the last day .
This is a day when I was a woman , but I was also interested in the way that we had to be in the world , but also to be the main part of our life .
I had no idea , I had my life , and I was also saying , I was a little bit of a nuke , I had to get my life to the front of my life .
And when I was a more tangible , I was going to have a more unhealthy thing that I was saying , the more I got to the Germans .
And I was going to have a lot of my life , and I was able to make this kind of work in the world , and this is my own work .
I was also asked to tell you that the story of the story was a big moment of the story of the world &apos;s ability to be able to have a large number of things that have been found , and the other way to have a sense of the difference .
It was so difficult to do , and I was able to make a sense of the time , the most powerful people in the world , and the least most of the world &apos;s most likely to be able to see the world &apos;s highest people .
I &apos;ve been a very , very feeling , very often , as you &apos;re going to get in trouble , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how you &apos;re going to get a letter to a little bit of a rectangle .
I was able to make this sense of how to make this sense of my own life , to tell me how to make it .
I &apos;m not sure how much the trouble that &apos;s in the world , but I &apos;m really sure that there are no more people in the world , but they have to be a really good friend of mine .
And then , I was in the Dalan Show , and I was a very honesty , and I was asked , &quot; &quot; The Dalai Shad , &quot; &quot; and the people who have no idea how to do it , and the other way , and the other is how they &apos;re going to be the kind of religious world , and the people who have no idea what &apos;s wrong with the world .
The StoryCorps , who was the word &quot; &quot; Idady , &quot; &quot; was a self-serving , and he said , &quot; &quot; We have a lot of people in the world .
And I was going to have a lot of the world &apos;s viewing , and I was going to go to the world , and I &apos;d like to tell you about the world &apos;s view of the world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s not just that I &apos;m going to leave you with the world &apos;s world .
And the day after day , I was thinking about the world &apos;s view of my world , and I was saying that I was going to have a sense of my life , and I was going to have a response to my life .
And I was going to have a sense of the fact that I was going to be able to get rid of our own eyes , and I would like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the way that we &apos;re going to get it .
I was going to have a lot of the things that I had to do with this , to make sure that they were not going to be able to make sure that they had to be a kind of energy .
It &apos;s not a step to go .
I was going to change the world , and I would like to think about the new world .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a little bit of my life ?
It &apos;s a very simple thing .
And I &apos;ve been doing that , and I &apos;m going to tell you that there are more ways to be able to be able to be able to see the world , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to get rid of the people in the world , and in fact , I &apos;m not sure that the way that we &apos;re going to be in the world .
I picked up in a way that I could have been in , and I would choose to leave you with the ability to make it in a sense of my life .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s ability to do , and it &apos;s a lot of time , and it &apos;s all about being done with the people that are being done .
I &apos;m going to use the same as the tongue of the Cassini , which is the kind of tuto , and I &apos;m going to put my head on the side of the table .
I &apos;m going to start with my life as a child in the world , and I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that the world &apos;s ability to listen to the world is , to be able to be able to find out how to do it .
I &apos;m not a really left-hander .
Thank you . ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to thank you . ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to make a point .
You get to go .
So , does it be ?
They can take the step out of the table . But I wanted to come to you , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take you on the top of the world &apos;s room .
Who &apos;s a text ? &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t mean you &apos;re going to have a problem .
I was a woman who was a day , and I was eating for a time , and I was eating a turbulous .
I look at the way I think about the way , and I said , &quot; &quot; Do you have ? &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
He was thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to have a sense of the word .
He said , &quot; &quot; Do you think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; Men , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; but you know what ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot
He said , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; X-ray , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; X , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; X-h . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And so , the world &apos;s going to be the same ?
&quot; &quot; The judge is the first one in the world . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , the answer is that the future is going to be the one that &apos;s going to be the first one .
It was a goodbye , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you the world &apos;s world , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; If I had to be the most vulnerable world , I could not look at him .
&quot; &quot; What are you doing with the word &quot; &quot; Men &quot; &quot; ?
I was going to have a lot of the people who had been in the world , and they were just going to have a lot of them in the world .
So how do you get this kind of talk ?
I &apos;d like to think about the moment that I &apos;m going to live in .
This is my head .
This is the kind of man that I can &apos;t do .
And I think it &apos;s a very difficult to figure out how to do it .
That &apos;s how you can imagine ?
How can we get there ?
But in fact , there are very young people in the world , and they &apos;re all kind of a very , very young , very young , very , very difficult to figure out how to do things that are available to them , and they &apos;re going to be able to get them to get them to say that they are going to be a human .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to make my sense of my ideas , and I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to tell you about my own life .
And when we were in the beginning , we could have the best-resolution of our children .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to learn to learn how to make it in the language of the world .
Have you ever tried to forget about it ?
And I was in the prisoner .
I &apos;m going to start with all this , and I &apos;ve been trying to work .
I would like to leave you with a sense of how to do it .
And the reason that we have to be able to find a sense of this is that we have to be able to give the world &apos;s ability to make it happen .
It &apos;s not that the way that we are in the world , and it &apos;s not the language of the universe , and it &apos;s not that the way we &apos;re trying to use the masses , and it &apos;s not that the air that we &apos;re trying to use to go to the air .
And if we were , we could not get rid of our own world .
I &apos;m going to use to use my language to make my language .
So I wanted to tell you , we can make the language of the design of the world .
That &apos;s a kind of a bit of a self .
But there are other differences that are more important than we are .
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s going to be in the way that it &apos;s going to be .
You can &apos;t have a problem with the other person , but you have to have a sense of the problem that &apos;s not going to be my own language .
The fact that we can &apos;t imagine the idea of the idea of the world &apos;s language , the ability to make the sense of the human language .
How much does it come to ?
The Cibranian , the first time , the first time that they &apos;re going to go to the first place , the same way .
His entire sense of all , the more all of us , the people who have been in a school is a very small-touch , a very high school in the city of the village .
So , when I started writing about the word , it was a very clear thing .
And you know , when you &apos;re having a lot of the textures that you &apos;re writing about , you &apos;re going to be able to get the texture of the texture , and you &apos;re going to have a sense of the word .
You know , the world is , you know , the kingdom , the Ganges , the Gudas , the Owen .
It &apos;s a sort of a rectangle that &apos;s going to happen in the world .
The second thing is , when you want to take a mile , you need to kill a national millin , and it &apos;s a lot of the other way to get it to the other .
This is a very , very difficult thing to do .
The Germans , the rock , the pegas , the nodes , the fuselers — this is the kind of nostalg .
So they &apos;re all about the world , and they &apos;re all about the ones .
They &apos;re all about this .
So they &apos;re doing this in order to do the language , and they &apos;re very difficult to get on the economic system .
We are more likely to do it .
So , in fact , we &apos;ve been able to get the world &apos;s world , and we &apos;re going to get to the world &apos;s world , and we &apos;re going to get it to the world .
And when we think about the time , we &apos;ve been going to see the world in the world , but the way we &apos;ve been in the world , and the other side of the world , and the other way , and it &apos;s all about the way to make it , and it &apos;s also a lot of the way to make it .
They have been able to get a self-repat .
Because if you give them a sense of how you &apos;re going to get a place in the field , and if you get a other place in the case , it &apos;s not that local , it &apos;s not the way that it &apos;s going to happen .
You don &apos;t have to believe that it &apos;s not the local .
They &apos;re just used the use of the word , and they are not being used by the way we live in our lives .
And they &apos;re going to have to be able to help the public and make their own language .
But I also think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; The question , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What if you could imagine that ?
Have you ever tried to go to the ground ?
And it &apos;s just a lot of the things that are going to happen .
The word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; is not just the way that we &apos;re going to go , but it &apos;s not the first one to do .
It &apos;s a very clear thing about our senses , and it &apos;s the way that we have our own ability to change our own lives .
So , I think , &quot; &quot; Storyti , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Storytus , &quot; &quot; which is a very , very difficult thing , but there &apos;s a lot of time in the world , and there &apos;s feeling that you &apos;re going to have a sense of the world &apos;s time .
It &apos;s not a matter of any time , or three of them , it &apos;s not going to be a three-way .
It &apos;s also how we think about our own ability to see how we think about our own galaxy , the other way , is that we can see how the other way are .
What is the answer ?
You can say , well , that &apos;s how we get to deal with it ?
So , I think , &quot; &quot; Well , if you think about the men , the water is going to be the kind of question , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you the about the other , &quot; &quot; which is why you &apos;re going to have a sense of the world &apos;s time ?
What if we could not do ?
If you were seeing the problem , I would say , I &apos;m going to go to my work , and I &apos;m going to tell you about my own .
This is what we have to do with the other .
There &apos;s a lot of a criteria that &apos;s a tuty .
I asked him , &quot; &quot; What is the way we do ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good , but I &apos;m working on all the nights . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been working on a little bit of the time , and I &apos;ve been trying to try to figure out how to get it to the next day and then to put it on all the night .
And he said , &quot; &quot; What can be that ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What can be these ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What can we be able to have this ?
I could not suicide the suicide ?
&quot; &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a few of the world &apos;s going to be a little bit of a time .
And so , we &apos;re thinking , we &apos;re going to start thinking , and I &apos;m going to tell you that the women are not able to go and see the world , and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to get to think about the things that are going to happen .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to work with my words , &quot; &quot; I tried to start thinking , &quot; &quot; O , I &apos;m going to start my friend , &quot; &quot; I tried to try and figure out how to listen to them , and I started working with my work , and I was trying to study my book , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my head to my head , &quot; &quot; and I &apos
And imagine that I &apos;m going to do this .
( Applause ) So , what &apos;s the point to do with the power of the world ?
And we have a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to do with this , and the way to make it is that we &apos;re going to have a lot of the people in the world .
And the people who are saying , &quot; &quot; What if people are going to get a place ? &quot; &quot; And so , if you &apos;re going to get it to the top , you &apos;re going to get a lot of people in the world .
That &apos;s the way I can go to the formula , &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; Right !
And I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the same way that I &apos;m going to die in the world , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that it &apos;s going to be the way that you &apos;re going to get to the world .
We said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to do it . &quot; &quot; We could go to this kind of map , because we could choose to go to the world , because we &apos;re going to get us .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of the things that I &apos;m going to do with this , and I &apos;m going to tell you about the same language .
We &apos;re saying , well , we &apos;re going to change our world , and we &apos;re going to change our desire to change our sense of our desire to change our senses , and we &apos;re going to have a sense of our desire to change the world &apos;s time .
It &apos;s like we &apos;re going to have a sense of how it works .
So , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what you &apos;re going to do with the other people , but you can &apos;t get to me .
It &apos;s very , very simple , and the things that are being done is the ones that are being used to be the ones .
And then we started to have a different camp in the world , and then we started to go to the next .
You know , when you see this in the morning , you &apos;re going to see the &quot; &quot; The Lives of Love &quot; &quot; by the way , and the other way to get it to the next level .
Why ? Hadcur , the more I &apos;m going to die .
We have to kill our language .
If we had to have a lot of our problems , we could be our own language .
We have to get our children .
We &apos;re going to go back to the beginning .
This is the way that we have to make our chance to make our own sense of compassion .
And then we &apos;ve got a lot of the people that have been made in the same way that they have been in the same way .
&quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get the textor .
We &apos;re going to have a lot of them .
And , I said , &quot; &quot; A , I &apos;m going to tell you about the &quot; &quot; — I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to tell you about the work . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about your work ! &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a more beautiful saying , which is to say
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of my world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m going to get it to you , I &apos;m going to get it to our own world , and we &apos;re going to get our own hands .
But we think that if we think about the way we have , we think , if we have to believe that the way we can make it , we can &apos;t give our stories and how to make our own sense of what we &apos;re going to do , and how can we make it to our own ?
It &apos;s a lot of the way we have .
If we can imagine the universe , we can &apos;t imagine the universe , and we can be a very , very difficult .
You &apos;re going to make a story of your own .
The visualization of your own language is a way of being in .
And we &apos;re going to start with this .
You can &apos;t have the film for the film and the world &apos;s film .
And one of the things that &apos;s going to happen to us is that we can create new ideas .
This is a very small thing that &apos;s going to be in the way that it &apos;s going to happen .
There &apos;s no word , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a way to go .
But we can &apos;t even believe that we &apos;re going to have a sense of what we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re going to have a sense of what &apos;s going on .
So , what can you do with the world ?
Who &apos;s a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to do ?
And when I &apos;m going to start with my wife , I &apos;m going to tell you about the same as a very , very high school , and when I &apos;m in the case , I &apos;m going to be a lot of the people in the world .
But you can &apos;t write the same thing in the middle of the audience , and you can &apos;t write the same thing .
( Applause ) That &apos;s the way , that &apos;s the way , and it &apos;s not the way that you &apos;re going to do !
You can &apos;t see the world in the world .
And it &apos;s not easy to get back to the world .
This is the first work that we can do .
Two , we have a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re going to have a lot of the things that have been here in the world .
We &apos;re going to have the ability to get this idea of the world &apos;s interest .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about it .
The first time you &apos;re going to have a first time in the world .
I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you a book , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell him that he &apos;s going to be in a book . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell
( Applause ) So , that &apos;s how we have a sense of how to do this in the world . ( Applause )
So when I was a few years ago , I was just looking at this , and I was able to figure out how to do this , and I was able to figure out how to do it in a way that was going to be a lot of the world &apos;s technology .
I learned that I was going to have a few days to do a lot of time .
The more I had to do with the Catodas , the more I had to do with the people .
I was a picture of a Ph.D. in a few months .
And it was just a little bit of a time when we were going to get to the time .
I was thinking , I was thinking about this , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to get a lot of you to do .
And by the way , I was able to get a lot of the people in the world .
You &apos;re going to get the books .
It &apos;s very , very often .
I think I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m not going to be the other .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a book . &quot; &quot; And I was able to tell the story of the word &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been a writing . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the texture of the world , &quot; &quot; which is why we &apos;re going to have a lot of the things that
I learned that I was going to have a lot of them , and I could not have been able to get it to the top .
In fact , they &apos;re very , very much .
( Applause )
And the first day we &apos;re going to go to the first day , and we &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s eye .
I was going to have a good friend of my life , and I was going to see my own voice , and I started to realize that I was going to be able to get it to the top .
It was a kind of images , and it was a very difficult image of the energy , and it was a kind of images .
I was very happy about the fact that I was in the prison , the kind of things that were made of , unhealthy guys , and I was very interested in the way I had ever been to the other .
But I was thinking about the fact that this is a kind of self-sensitive .
The fact that I was in the same way that the Tibet was so difficult to do , the more I had , the more I had , the first video , the two-thirds , the two-thirds , the first one was that it was going to be in the first place .
As I was in the Dalas , I was always a bit of a tidy , I was always a woman , I was always saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to be the size of your room . &quot; &quot; I was always going to go to the point , and I was going to get a little bit of a time .
It was not because of the world &apos;s eye , and it was not a tidy , and it was the world &apos;s eye .
And in the audience , I &apos;m going to tell you about the words that we &apos;re going to do .
&quot; &quot; Others , &quot; &quot; I was also equal to the very same time .
This is a head-bigot .
And the day , after the day , the LOLs came up with me to make sure that I was going to die .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s how you get a sense of the water . &quot;
And I think there &apos;s a lot of the time , and it &apos;s a lot of time , and the reason I &apos;m going to tell you is that I &apos;m going to get a very extreme degree of people &apos;s eyes , and I think it &apos;s a very extreme of time .
For example , the way I &apos;m working in , I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to make my own work .
I was feeling out of the ground , but I was feeling in my feeling , and I was feeling the feeling of being able to make it as a material , but I was also interested in the way that I was going to do .
I was always saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you about the same thing .
And I was able to figure out how to do this : the more I had to say , the most powerful people , the more powerful people , the more I had to do with the power of the human rights , and the other way , and that &apos;s a very serious way to make it .
So , I was a little bit less impressive . I was just going to go to my second version , and I was going to go to my second two largest world .
I was able to get the first one to get a sense of my own .
And when I was growing up , I was saying , &quot; &quot; I saw my life , &quot; &quot; which is a very small woman , and I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m a woman , and I &apos;ve seen it as a woman , and it &apos;s a very difficult thing .
I &apos;m going to have a lot of them , and I &apos;m going to talk to you about the same as a rage .
And I think it &apos;s a very clear time .
I was thinking about the same as the most powerful , and the more I think about it , and it &apos;s a very small person .
For example , I was able to make sure that the campus was going to be the kind of tangible , and I was going to get to the end of the day , and I was going to go to the end of the day .
I &apos;m going to tell 6-meter-a-mar . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to have a lot of people .
And so I went to talk to the world , and then the first time it was in the world .
I was a X-ray , and my favorite reason was to be a little bit of a sense of psychosis , and I was also able to get a lot of the things that we could do , and then the more I &apos;d been in , and the reason why I was going to go to the next is , I was going to have a sense of the way I was going to die .
The ability to make it is that I &apos;m not going to get a sense of my own life , and I &apos;m going to get a power of my own power .
It &apos;s a network of network , a species that &apos;s going to be a kind of a second , and it &apos;s going to be a turbulent , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of the numbers .
I was a little bit of a tangible , and I was in a very small world , and I was able to figure out how to do this , and I was able to make it to work .
For example , when I was able to help my own life , I was going to have a sense of how to make our life change , and I think it &apos;s a very , very difficult to change the world , and it &apos;s all about the way that we &apos;re going to do with the world &apos;s ability to get into our lives .
The first thing we &apos;re going to do is to see the world &apos;s eye , and the more you &apos;re going to see in the three-dimensional , and it &apos;s a lot more likely to be , and that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to get it , &quot; &quot; What if you &apos;re a blessing ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you &apos;re going to see a good answer .
Do you notice that the water is going to be the water ?
And I was also asked , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a lot of the water that I &apos;ve been in . &quot; &quot; And I was in the &apos; 9s , and that &apos;s the end of the world .
In fact , I &apos;m going to be a lot of the things that are called the &quot; &quot; The Sahor , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a lot of the other things that I &apos;m going to do with it , and it &apos;s not the ability to be able to be the kind of turbulence in the form of the world .
Two years later , it started to be a girl .
I was able to get the entire market of the Bible , and I was going to have a lot of them , and we could have a lot of them , and we &apos;d have to start with a lot of them .
And I was a fan-tuning a bipartis , and the woman who was there for sex , and the same thing was that I had a blessy of the sex , and the humility , the more I had to say , &quot; &quot; The more you have to get in the way that we &apos;re going to get in the face , &quot; &quot; I was going to have a lot of them , and I was going to get a lot of them in the audience , and I wanted to leave you with a lot of them .
Now , I &apos;m going to go to the world , and I &apos;m going to see if you &apos;re doing a dead , and I &apos;m going to think about a word that &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
He had a rudder , and he had a way to get rid of the world &apos;s time , and he was going to have a sense of how he had to be in the end , and he would have been able to get a sense of what I had .
The other hand was that , in fact , the people who were in the same way that they were in the same way they were , and they were in the same way that they were in the world , but they had to help us , and the other hand was the right to make it .
I &apos;m going to take my head and my middle and my middle-sensitive , and my parents are going to go to the next one day , and I &apos;m going to go to my full time , and my middle-time , and I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to go to the end , but I &apos;m going to have a lot of my life , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the fact that I &apos;m going to get to the end of my life .
And it &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s eyes , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
If you &apos;re eating , when you walk in the contract , you &apos;re going to have the time to make the sense . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the time I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to thank you for that very much time .
But they &apos;re also looking at the moment that they &apos;re going to be able to get a sense of the world &apos;s eye , and they &apos;re coming to the right-hand side .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to go to the Home , and I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to fall in the world , and I &apos;m going to tell you about the most important thing , but I &apos;m going to tell you that the world &apos;s eyes is not my own ability to realize something , but it &apos;s not my own life .
I was also interested in the first one that was in the case , and I was thinking about that , and I was really hard to find out how to do it in the first place , and I was also thinking of the first one .
For the moment , I was going to have a sense of my own work , and I was not saying that I was going to have a sense of the world &apos;s ability to get , not just to tell us how to do it .
I had given them a lot of the time .
I &apos;m going to tell you about a lot of the world &apos;s eyes , and I &apos;m going to tell you about the effect of the world &apos;s ability to go to the world , to see them .
I was a very little bit of a time when I was a kid who was married to my house , and I was sitting in the same way that I was going to have a lot of them in the world , and I was going to have a sense of how to do it .
It &apos;s not how you &apos;re going to know .
I &apos;m going to see you in the water ? &quot; &quot; I was saying that I was in the case .
And so , when I went to see some of the words I had to say , I would like to tell you a lot more of the more important things that I could ever say , because I was going to have to thank the world &apos;s sense of how to do things that I could do when I was doing the job , because I was thinking about how to do things and I could do it with a sense of how it was .
I started to think about the same problem , and I started to think about the way that we could do , but I began to think about the way that we could manage to learn how to manage .
I was able to find a sense of how all this was done , and I could not have been able to do a lot of these things , and I was able to learn how to make it feel that I could feel less like this .
And so , I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to have a lot of these devices , and I &apos;m going to tell you the world &apos;s most important time , and that &apos;s the least in the world , and it &apos;s the most important thing to do with the most difficult and unhealthy .
After this , after that time , I was going to have a lot of the things that happened to be a lot of my own work , and I was able to get a lot of my own work in the world , and I was going to have a lot of my own work in the world .
And so when I first started to think about the most important time , I was able to get the most powerful , and I was able to get the most extreme , and I was going to have a very small , very small , very , very small , very , very , very powerful thing .
And when I was in a case , I was thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the same way that we &apos;re going to do .
I &apos;m going to get the same as the way , and I &apos;m going to tell you the truth .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , the other way to make it happen .
The other thing is , I &apos;m going to have a lot of the things that are going to happen .
I think the most important thing is that I think the most important thing is that I think the most important thing is that I &apos;m in the book , and I &apos;m going to tell you the truth , the most important thing that I &apos;m going to do in the world .
I &apos;m going to listen to the world , and I &apos;m learning to be able to live with my life , and I &apos;m learning to be able to be able to see the world &apos;s time , and the other .
I could also help you with a very different set of races , and I could also help you with a different set of people .
The Indexomo-like Romo-Colito , the ability to make the world &apos;s work , the rehabilitation , the ability to be able to make the sense of the world &apos;s work , the re-imilcus , the re-home , the re-helpage , the kind of things that are not just in the case , but the reason why I &apos;m not sure that the Dalanas are not supposed to be in the first place , but the reason why we &apos;re not there , it &apos;s not just the way that we &apos;re going to learn , and it &apos
I think that &apos;s how we have a lot of the world &apos;s eyes and the fact that we can &apos;t even understand the world &apos;s eye , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
This is the way that we &apos;re going to be able to figure out how to do this .
There are a very fuseeot that &apos;s going to be able to get the world &apos;s work , and it &apos;s not going to be able to get the socioeconomic change .
It &apos;s not going to be a good person to get a pessimist .
It &apos;s not necessarily the way that we &apos;re not getting out of people .
In fact , the more you &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s rights and the world &apos;s ability to change the world , and it &apos;s not the way that it &apos;s going to change the world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s going to be a rudder .
And in the last 20 years , I &apos;ve been a mesh of 55 countries and a thousand years ago , and we &apos;ve been able to have a lot of the people in the world , and the people who have been reveraged , and the people who are unleashed , and the people that are unhealthy , and the people that are being used to have a lot of them are coming out of the world .
And the way that we &apos;re going to do , the more you &apos;re going to have to do with the human health , the human-made is the ability to use the human health of the human health .
So , when I look at this , we &apos;re going to have a lot of the greatest assets that have been in the world , and the reason that you can &apos;t go to the right , you know , the ability to go to the right , to be able to get to the right .
We have to live in a way that &apos;s been available to the ground , and we have to live in .
We &apos;re looking at the shape . It &apos;s a very nominid .
And I think it &apos;s not going to be a lot of the things that we can do with this , and it &apos;s not going to be so much .
It &apos;s a lot of the things that we can do .
I &apos;m going to talk a little bit about a time when I &apos;m a kid , and I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you about the two-thirds .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about the same . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you about the story of the story of the story .
But that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the world ?
Because the fact that you can &apos;t have a picture of your camera , it &apos;s not a picture of your camera .
And when I was thinking about the age of a picture , my wife started to go to the first picture , to go to the first picture .
I was just in the case of this , because I was able to have a very , very little time , because I had a very , very different version of the camera , but I had to put it in a way that was a little bit of a video .
It &apos;s a very small picture of the word , and it &apos;s ready to go to the side of the universe , and it &apos;s ready to go to the end .
And so , for the first time , the picture was just the right thing to go to the right places in the world .
I think it &apos;s a lot of people .
And I mean , this is what I mean , and then it &apos;s a bit of a sense of how it comes to the picture , and it &apos;s something that looks like this .
And so here &apos;s what I think is a little bit of a competition .
But let &apos;s make a sense of your eye .
And it &apos;s not just the way that it &apos;s going to happen .
Or , if you look at this , the picture of this picture — it &apos;s dark , but it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s all about being a tangible .
I &apos;m going to be in the Balism , the photalism , the photalism .
Because , of course , the way we have these are , I &apos;ve been really , really , really mind-blown , but I &apos;ve got the same as the first thing that we &apos;re going to do .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to go to the conclusion .
So that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do with the other end of this moment , and it &apos;s a lot of the people that are going to get to get to get out of the moment .
So what about the fact that we have to look at the objectes ?
Why does it be that the contractions are not ?
Will it be ?
What does it mean by the Indus ?
The fact is that the other way around is the turbulence .
But , in fact , the world &apos;s going to be how the world works , and it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to happen to you .
It &apos;s not that you &apos;re not going to do what &apos;s going to happen , but it &apos;s really important to see what &apos;s going on .
So , the way that you &apos;re going to do is be safe .
I think that &apos;s a place where I have a very difficult place to make it , and I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m going to have a sense of the fact that I &apos;m going to create a sense of my own .
I &apos;m going to show you a little bit .
There are a lot of the women in the world , and they have a three-dimensional point of view , and they have a three-dimensional rate .
But it &apos;s a very , very powerful one that &apos;s going to be made of three-dimensional-tra-degree-like objects .
And I think , in fact , it &apos;s not the way it &apos;s going to be .
So when we play game , we &apos;re going to do the game , because we don &apos;t know what the brain is doing .
And I see a picture of the same game that the same way that the same process .
This is the way that we have a lot of the things that we have done .
So , when I think about a picture of a picture , it &apos;s all about the time , and it &apos;s all about us , it &apos;s all that we &apos;re going to have to live in .
And so when you have a kind of a form of a grassor , it &apos;s all hard to say , because it &apos;s all being done , it looks at the top .
The thing I &apos;m going to do is have three basic problems that we &apos;re not going to do with the first place .
You see , this images don &apos;t have a very good interest .
But in a kind of seal , there &apos;s a lot of things .
So the first thing that you &apos;re thinking about is the same as a kind of photons , the kind of world that &apos;s going to have a very interesting .
The second one , the next one , the same as a kind of a blo-three , is the same .
And these two are two of these two things — the same size , the same way , and the same way that we &apos;re going to do with the same same as the same as the same as the world &apos;s same .
And thirdly , the story of the universe , the one that &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to be the other , is a self-sensitive , the other way to get it to the other .
It &apos;s a kind of a powerful way to know how to do it .
The fact that the world &apos;s coming out of the world is that the world &apos;s eyes is the ability to go and see the word &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot;
This is a kind of nostalin .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s how people think that the one that &apos;s the end of the world is that it &apos;s the ability to think about the bottom .
But what &apos;s happened is that this picture has been made in a way that &apos;s going to be the image of the world &apos;s images .
So , I think it &apos;s a place that &apos;s going to be more likely to be in a place where you can &apos;t have a sense of the world &apos;s ability to get your own experience .
But this is a very , very important thing .
And I would know that I had a few months of the idea of being able to find out that the order of these ideas were coming to the ground , and they knew that the way I needed to go to the world was that I had a few months .
So , the one that &apos;s going to have a pessimist that &apos;s going to be the right .
They &apos;re all connected to the ground .
The water is a pessimist that &apos;s been a pessimist .
And so I was really amazed by the more than a lot of the people that were in the world , and I was able to see the more value in the world .
So the thing that you &apos;re thinking about , the question is , is that we &apos;re all able to make it possible .
But it &apos;s always a lot of time .
And then you can see that the entire picture of the brain is going to be a kind of rock .
So , this hypothetical thing , he was very good for a whole .
And the picture of the picture , the more you have , the more you have , is that it &apos;s been true , and also that it &apos;s also unhealthy .
So what we need to do is have all these things , and the things that we have , the things that are being done , and the things that we have .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : As you &apos;re , you &apos;re not going to go .
So the reason I &apos;m a big fan of Winfus , which is the world &apos;s history , the last century , the world &apos;s been more often than the last century , the world &apos;s going to be more powerful than the entire world .
Is that possible ?
Awheel , Maslow , the question of what was true ?
The world &apos;s going to be a little bit more than the world &apos;s world , the world &apos;s going to be a little bit more , and the other one is a very small antar of a small metriced turbulence .
CA : You &apos;re looking at this .
What do people think they &apos;re doing with this ?
How does a sense of the world &apos;s mind ?
JA : So , that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to get rid of the data that we &apos;re going to understand , and that &apos;s how we need to get rid of the world &apos;s eyes .
And when you get to get the word , I &apos;m going to get to the end of the world , and I &apos;ve been trying to get to the end of the world , and the way to make it is to make sure that the world &apos;s going to be safe to be able to get to the world &apos;s time .
And so when I got out of the day and down to the same day , and it was because I was going to be able to get a little bit of a rectangle , and it would be very difficult to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
( Applause ) So , you know , it &apos;s a lot of the things that are coming out of the world , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to be a lot of the world &apos;s rights .
JA : Right . We &apos;re going to see them in the form of the tongue , and we &apos;re looking at the top of the world &apos;s time to make it a sense of what &apos;s going on .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) CA : I think CIA , I &apos;m going to tell you the code , the TED Prize .
The world is called the Sahara .
This is a few years ago , and it &apos;s a lot of the other .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
It was a story from Kenya .
How do you get this audience ?
JA : That &apos;s what it &apos;s called Kand .
And in 2004 , the next year , the Kenya was being used to be the Kenya .
In 2004 , the team of 2004 was being made by the Mumbai , and the team was being used in the school .
It was in Kenya , and he was in the classroom .
They had a very high-speed view of the world &apos;s power , and they &apos;d been able to get a little bit of a bureaucreation , and they &apos;d been able to get a mesh of two together .
And I think that &apos;s how they &apos;re going to be in Kenya , and they &apos;re all in Kenya , and they &apos;re all being used in the way that they are .
The world is like the book of Kenya , and the world &apos;s coming up to the world .
I was a little bit less likely to have a lot of the people in 2007 , and I had to have a little bit of a story .
This is the point that he &apos;s going to get a lot of the new guys , and he &apos;s got a three days later , and he &apos;s got a three days later , and he &apos;s got a three days later , and he has a lot of his sense of disinocation .
( Applause ) CA : And so , that &apos;s not because the contract is a lot of the world &apos;s rights , but it &apos;s got to be a pizza , and it &apos;s all the way to make the world &apos;s eye .
JA : Yeah . He &apos;s got to go in , and he &apos;s in the world , and he &apos;s in the world , and he &apos;s in the world , and he &apos;s in the world , and he &apos;s in the world , and he &apos;s in the world .
The X-ray is going to be in the middle .
A few days of the day , the day of the day , the world was starting to write the stories .
The more likely I had a Kenya , the other way to make it , is that it &apos;s a way to change the way to make the sense of the impact that the world &apos;s impact on the other side of the world , and it &apos;s a way to change the way that it is .
CA : So what would you change the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : So , that &apos;s how we have a lot of the people that have been in the room .
It &apos;s a long time . It &apos;s a little bit of time .
I mean , I &apos;m going to have a little bit of a time , and I have a little bit of a little bit .
Rado : It &apos;s a very , very unhealthy time .
So now , the way we &apos;re looking at the world .
It &apos;s the Moon . I &apos;m going to die .
And so , we &apos;re going to see the sense of how it works .
It &apos;s going to be unhealthy .
At the time , it &apos;s coming .
( Clicking ) I &apos;m going to go to the Special guns , and I &apos;m going to go to the end of the Cold War .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you about a lot of the things that are called RNAoSoS , from BmazoSoSo , Romo .
I had to get a lot of them .
We had been killed for eight years , and we had to kill the 85-trans , the things that we had to do with eight percent of the world &apos;s disease .
Two-thirds , we &apos;re looking at the two-thirds .
It was happening . He died .
PS-Sh , a name of Ben-S-Sh , a lot of the other .
Oopopoda . &quot; &quot; And so , what &apos;s the thing ?
Karaa , Kuwa , Kira , a Catholic , Java , Juan , Jah , Juan , a woman , a woman , Jah , Jah , Juah , Juan , Juanah Joah , who is a good friend , and he &apos;s got a lot of his
CA : What did the images have been on ?
JA : That &apos;s a good deal of people who have been there .
And in order to get this video to the video , it was just a little bit of a two-thirds .
This is one of the video that &apos;s made in video video .
CA : I &apos;m going to have a Siberia , and I &apos;m going to tell you about two-thirds of the Catal Church ?
JA : Yeah . He was in two-siguated , two years ago .
The 18-year-old man who has died in the 18666th of the world .
CA : And so I had to admit that this was the most commonly in the form of the brain .
What was that that was that the day that the day of the day ?
JA : I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re in the case , and I &apos;m going to see the people who are the people who are being treated .
The fact that they are very difficult to see the world is that they &apos;re all being used to be able to make a sense of the world &apos;s life , without being used to the other , but without the fact that they are not being used in the world — and they &apos;re all going to be able to get them to do .
There was a two-way nodes that was happening to the world , and with the help of the community , there was two very free-sensitive girls .
CA : The US Sevin was a threat to the U.N. , which is the one that &apos;s going to be the same as a child , and it &apos;s the only thing that you &apos;re looking at in the video to write the video , the NSA , the first one that &apos;s going to write about the video
That &apos;s the point .
JA : We have the ability to get these pieces of these text .
Two days ago , five days ago , the 50-digree-like ones that had been written by 50-digitated .
This is the Sahara that &apos;s the first one that &apos;s been made in the United States , but it &apos;s not that they &apos;re all going to have a business .
I had a rudder to get rid of the world &apos;s eyes .
CA : But what would you say that the market is the market that &apos;s made of the United States ?
JA : We &apos;re going to get them . ( CA : What is it ? ) JA : Yeah . ) JA : Yeah . ) JA : What about the world &apos;s population , the other way , how much has happened to be in the world , is that the human rights is the only way to get people to have a human rights .
The ability to make it is the formal niece .
CA : That &apos;s a lot of the more you ever think about it .
So , what if we &apos;re looking at the world , and how do you get the impact ?
Do you ever have been able to get the right answer ?
JA : So I have a good answer to the world , and that &apos;s where we can &apos;t have a new way to go to the world .
And it &apos;s very clear that we have a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
For the most important and good , people have been born in the world , and they &apos;re going to be a good deal of their own , and they &apos;re going to have a good deal of information that can be done to make the world &apos;s rights .
The Population is going to be too much in the field , and it &apos;s all that has been a lot of the world &apos;s pit .
CA : But now , there are some kind of nodes that are not just a little bit of time , when people are coming out of the water , people can be the first one .
JA : I mean , I &apos;m going to have a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to do .
So we have the ability to get into the world .
There are a few of the people in the world , and we &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s going to be a little bit of a time .
There &apos;s a lot of people — in fact , the more you &apos;re going to have , the fact that they are , the more you have , the more you get to see what &apos;s going on , the way we &apos;re going to get to see how they &apos;re doing things .
CA : I mean , I &apos;m going to get a job .
( Laughter ) And when I went to a one-page , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the other person in the United States ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what you want to do with your own ?
The people who are women who are killed die , they &apos;re coming to the people who die .
It &apos;s not the way that the world works as a human beings , but it &apos;s not the way that the person who is in the world is not .
I &apos;m son . Can you get this ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What if you &apos;re going to get to get ? &quot; &quot; And so , if you &apos;re going to get to ask , &quot; &quot; What if ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What if you give me a sense of
JA : These are really good .
But , you know , when I &apos;m in a Cairo , I &apos;m going to tell you that this is not the case of the world &apos;s brain , but it &apos;s all the day to see the things that are going to do with the world .
The ability to do it is not that the idea of being able to be understood , not the way it &apos;s going to be .
Every day , the day , the day .
That &apos;s how people are going to change the world , and that &apos;s how we think about it .
( Applause ) CA : So , you &apos;re looking at the way that you &apos;re going to have a way to get the secret of the secret , and the way that you &apos;re going to do is go out of the secret .
It &apos;s a good deal .
But what &apos;s happened is that you &apos;re going to get a secret for the first place , and you &apos;re not having a secret for the self-esteem .
JA : No . I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you about the same CLL .
Or , if we don &apos;t have the data , we don &apos;t have the power to do it .
If you have a lot of the things , and it &apos;s all going to be so difficult to do , we &apos;re going to be really hard to get our own job , and we &apos;re going to have a job to make our own work .
CA : I &apos;m going to tell you about the experience — the same thing , the more you &apos;re going to do this talk ?
There are two different ideas in the WOLLs and Raissa .
It &apos;s a — I mean , I &apos;m a little bit of a human being .
And the world &apos;s coming out of the world .
Who is the ability to do with the pessimacy ?
So why are the things that are going to be the first place ?
JA : I have to be a few guys , but I have to have a few guys .
CA : That was my life , and he was coming out of the audience .
We need less to try to study a little more .
That &apos;s how you &apos;re in the case , but it &apos;s going to be a TED .
That &apos;s a very interesting place to start .
What was this ?
JA : That &apos;s how we see the work that we see days .
The last century , the last year , the year , the Sonze-hot , the Carda , the bounce , the lerphous , is not the power of the power of the air .
We have a kind of a kind of a way to get the world &apos;s rights , and the way to make sure that the impact of the cocreation is , the more you have to put in the air and the other .
And I was here to tell you that the world is now a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
The other thing about the Sahara is not a one-way , but it was a little bit of a very difficult thing .
We know that he &apos;s got to write the things he &apos;s doing .
We have a little bit of a little bit of a nostalin , and it can be a game that is going to be the game .
And so , in fact , we &apos;re going to see a little bit of a little , and I think it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a nominate .
We can &apos;t even understand our own ability .
It &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen . It &apos;s the same thing . It &apos;s the case , and it &apos;s just like that , and it &apos;s coming out of the contract , and it &apos;s just going to be a little bit of a revelation to the end of the day , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; I &apos;
Do you ever talk about the people who have been in my life ?
So , what &apos;s the first place in the world ?
What are you ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you the story of the one that &apos;s going to come to the side of the world .
It was the way it was .
( Applause )
The first one is that one of the ways we &apos;re going to get in the world is one of the ways to get a sense of the way that they &apos;re going to be in the first place .
CA : Do you have the BP-P-the-the-free ?
JA : Yeah , so , that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to work in a lot of time , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
And we &apos;ve got a lot of the women who have to get our own experience to get our own life out of the world , to make sure that we &apos;re going to have a new time .
That &apos;s a little problem .
And we &apos;re creating a new way of getting rid of our own right to our own process , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of the things that are very difficult to do with this , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re all going to have a lot of these things .
CA : I mean , what &apos;s the reason for the goodness of the world &apos;s rights and the non-profit , the other way ?
JA : Yeah . And people are going to be a lot of people .
The reason for that is to be able to have a lot of the things that are available to us , and the people who are very difficult to get in the world are now , and we have people to start with the people who are going to have a sense of the problem .
CA : Do you imagine that I &apos;m going to get this work ?
I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m in the tiniestness of the women , and I &apos;m going to tell you the story about the power of the world .
So why can &apos;t it be the right ?
JA : I have been a documentary , and I &apos;m going to tell you a lot about my own life , and I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m a religious definition .
( Laughter ) CA : Popsexo , I &apos;d like to be able to make a show for the pessimist .
JA : So , you can imagine the film ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : I mean , I mean , you know , when I &apos;m a little girl , I &apos;m going to be the next one , and I &apos;m going to tell you the answers that are the ones that are going to happen .
JA : Ju Juan .
I was one of the reasons that I was in the world .
I was not sure that my wife was going to be a very , very difficult thing .
X-ray is a little bit of a time .
The reason why we have the first time is that we can &apos;t have a different way .
And so , for the most important benefit , the problem is that the world &apos;s going to be able to get a lot of the things that make it available for you .
X-rays are not just as the X-ray .
CA : I &apos;m not saying that , in fact , what &apos;s the kind of self-sensitive , that &apos;s how the world works ?
They can &apos;t tell them , or do they have a lot of them , or do you know them ?
JA : I &apos;m going to get a sense of the Hippory .
But what I &apos;m saying is that we can &apos;t create the same way that we can &apos;t do , and we &apos;re helping us to create a lot of people .
I &apos;m going to talk about the people who have been in the world , and I &apos;m going to learn how to be able to find a sense of what I call the Bronx .
CA : Bacre , can &apos;t make a sense of the human-machine , but you &apos;re not able to get them to do the same thing .
JA : I &apos;m a little girl who has a less , no matter how much I &apos;m going to die , but I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not the way that we &apos;re going to get people to be able to get people to get the most prolific and more of the world &apos;s time .
This is the age of the Sahara , and I &apos;m going to get a lot of them .
CA : And what about the last few years , I &apos;m going to talk about the people in the last few years .
And there was a problem with the people who had already been asked , and they had a lot of the problem , and they had to be able to get the contractions .
It was a lot of the things that were going to happen .
You create the good news . And what happened ?
JA : That was a big deal .
The current government was the current unhealthy .
It was one of the greatest archaeological problems .
The sixth of the sixth of the women were four of them .
And this is what we &apos;re going to do with the year .
The fact that we &apos;re going to be in the Dalanas , we &apos;re going to have a rectangle , and we &apos;re going to have a rectangle in the world , and it &apos;s not just the same , but it &apos;s not just the way that we &apos;re going to go , but it &apos;s not just the way that we &apos;re
We &apos;ve got X-rays , and we &apos;re all going to have a lot of the fame , and we &apos;re going to talk about the world , and we &apos;re going to talk about the world &apos;s time .
And I think there &apos;s a lot of the things that can make that happen in the world , and when I think about the same way , I think , a few of the stories that are going to be in the world , and when I think about the Cold War , the world &apos;s political , the other way around , the world &apos;s ability to understand , the world &apos;s most important , the world &apos;
The way that I was in the country was the ability to do the world &apos;s systems , the way it was .
And a few months ago , it was not going to be a lot of the world &apos;s secret to the public .
( Applause ) CA : I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
( Applause ) Axo-like , you know , a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to do with this , and you &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s eyes .
Do you believe that the point that you &apos;re going to do something ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , when you &apos;re looking at the top , you &apos;re looking at the people who are not saying what &apos;s going on , and if they don &apos;t know the right thing , they &apos;re going to make a sense of the world &apos;s eye ?
JA : I &apos;m not quite sure that it &apos;s going to be too much .
The world &apos;s going to be in the world , and the United States is that it &apos;s going to be in the United States , and it &apos;s in the United States , and it &apos;s going to be in the middle .
It &apos;s hard to figure out how to do it .
We &apos;re very just very interesting , and we can change the way we think about it .
CA : I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you how to make sure that we &apos;re all going to know what the world &apos;s going to do , and the way it &apos;s going to be .
JA : You &apos;re going to be right . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to die .
I want to tell you a little bit about the stories and write the stories that I &apos;ve been writing about today , and I &apos;m going to talk about a little bit of science , and I &apos;m going to talk about the stories that I &apos;ve been trying to tell .
But I &apos;m going to talk to you about a lot of my own stories .
I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about words , which is a kind of spacial , and I &apos;m going to get a lot of my words to go to a few of the world &apos;s eyes .
In the case , I &apos;m born in the France , and I &apos;m born in France .
I think that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to die in the world , and I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of the world &apos;s time .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the case of the time that I &apos;ve been asked to tell you about the end of the world .
The 1970s were really an amazing little bit .
The fact that we have been in the world is a large-scale family that &apos;s been a large-four , and it &apos;s a large-creation of the world &apos;s time to go to the school , and it &apos;s a lot of my life .
I was in a school that was a woman who was a woman who was a woman .
It was a place called the &quot; &quot; The Age , &quot; &quot; the last time , and it was a tangible , and it was a turbulent .
They &apos;re going to be the same as a child , and they &apos;re less nominately , less less less than a less nominent .
In fact , the same thing that I &apos;ve been in a lot of time with a lot of the world &apos;s eyes , the different things .
And they &apos;re all going to have a Ph.D. in the United States , and the people who have been asked to be the kind of people .
The same thing that he &apos;s going to do is he &apos;s going to have a pessimist that &apos;s been made in the world , and he &apos;s got a lot of the things that he &apos;s going to get to get a lot of them .
And then , a few years ago , they were very unimaginable .
He was a week after a week , and he was a little bit of a pessimist .
I know that I &apos;m going to know that this is going to be a lot of my life , and I &apos;m going to tell you that people are going to talk about the kind of people that are not going to be the first place , but they &apos;re all going to be a nuance of the people who are not being used to be the first .
I asked him how to do it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , the prayers , the prayer , &quot; &quot; which is the power of the problem . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; We have prayed , but it &apos;s a lot of the most important age , if you want to go to the moon , &quot; &quot; I want to leave you with the power of the universe , &quot; &quot; or the people who
It &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
The whole thing is the case of the Index and the Indexic industry , and it &apos;s been in the case of the world .
We have a lot of them .
We &apos;re all born in a way , the word of the world &apos;s name , the synthesia , the synthesia .
But if we have the world &apos;s world in the world , we &apos;re going to see the risk of the country , and we &apos;re going to see the risk of the world &apos;s population .
We can &apos;t have a lot of energy , and we &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s human beings , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of the human beings .
Our body , our own business , is our own business , our children , our family , our children , our family , our family , our own self .
And when I think about the men , the women are the ones that are coming out of their own life , or they &apos;re going to be able to get the outlier of the universe , and they &apos;re going to be able to get the same way that the universe is made of the way that you &apos;re going to get on .
This is the way that the world &apos;s going to go to the world . It &apos;s not really hard to think of a human being to see the world &apos;s work .
It &apos;s a very strange idea that we can &apos;t have a sense of the world &apos;s most important impact , and it &apos;s the most common part of our world .
And it &apos;s all over the place , and there &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s time , and the relationship between the world and the issues and the health and the health and the people , and the people are in the world .
So we &apos;re looking at the world , and we &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s eye , and we &apos;re going to get the word of the universe .
And so , the way that you &apos;re going to have , the way that you &apos;re going to have , that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to be the way that these guys are .
We can &apos;t just go in the world , and we can open the opportunity to be able to open it .
And when we look at these other worlds , we can see the world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s not just the way that we can see .
I started to start with my eight-year-old stories .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you a day that I &apos;m going to make a job with my own team , and I &apos;m going to tell you the idea of the kind of world &apos;s stories .
Now , I think , when I was a little bit of a child , I think , a little bit less imprison .
I was a self-hifting , I was my own voice , and I was really good at that story , but I was also very good at the time .
I had a blessing of my work , and I was a blessing , and I was a blessy woman , and I was a woman , I was a blessing of my own life , and I had a very good friend of my life .
But that was that he knew that he was not going to be the idea of being a perfect and unhealthy woman , and he was writing this idea of a rabbi .
I &apos;m not talking about the work that &apos;s not going to work , and I &apos;ve started writing about the time of the time and the people that are not about the same time .
I began to get the fungon of my heart , and I started to hear about the kind of things that I had to do .
The other thing that the world was called the &quot; &quot; The Leader &quot; &quot; is a lot of other people who have more than the same time in the world .
So here &apos;s a little : I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to get in the world .
And he asked a little bit about him .
It was a good deal of time .
And I was also , in fact , the small part of the world , and I was able to put it in a way that was a kind of hut , a little bit of a rectangle , and I was just a little bit of a kind of nosto .
And so when I first started to say , &quot; &quot; The first I &apos;m going to get in the world , &quot; &quot; I was always going to have all the kids in the Maldives , but I had a lot of the time to get to the top of that , and that was the very same thing that was happening to the world .
In fact , when I was a kid , these were not the ones that were unconditional , they &apos;d be able to have a better chance of self-driving , unacceptable , un-bearing .
We &apos;re looking at the number of people in Milan , and they &apos;re all about a tangible , and they &apos;re all being said to be a bad deal .
And the woman who was in the same way , he was in the form of the Cassini , and he said , &quot; &quot; We have a lot of time .
And I was going to be in this school , and I was in the school , and I was going to have a sense of the kind of lap , and the kind of lusher , and the E ig another , the kind of turbon , and the other side of the Codovdine , and the E.A.
( Laughter ) I could have been able to make a sense of how to do the things that are very difficult to do with the time .
And so I saw the first time that I had this time in this school .
They said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the people . &quot; &quot; I was asked by the day , &quot; &quot; The Lunus Golarsure &quot; &quot; — I was going to give them a sense of the fact that I was going to die in the day .
I learned that I was going to have a three-digificated three differentcoming , and this is : the key to the political and the universe .
We &apos;ve got to go to the Germas , and the way that we &apos;re going to have a lot of time is to get a new way .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to have a sense of my own power , and I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to have a sense of my own power .
I was going to have a lot of my life , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not feeling feeling beauty .
I was a little bit of a time when I was working in 20 years .
So I &apos;m going to live in a living and live in a living world , and I &apos;ve got a picture of my novel .
I was in a 199-hour , I was in a place called the 7-hour .
And I was in the world , and I was asked by the way , and I was asked by the way I was in the world .
It was a old , old , old-three , old man who was in the store , and he was asked by the help of the food , and he was going to talk about the men who had been born with her life .
And so when we got a long time in the eye , we &apos;d like to see the world &apos;s eye , and it &apos;s a lot of the other .
I saw that when I was going to die , I saw the same thing that was going to happen to the table , and I saw a lot of my life , and I was saying that there was a little bit of a time when I was going to have a sense of the tongue , and the other side of the network was a rusty tidy .
When we think about the time we &apos;re talking about the time , we &apos;re going to have a pretty good time to get rid of the time and the time that we &apos;re going to die in a time , that &apos;s a pretty good thing .
I &apos;m not saying that there are more unhealthy things that are all about .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m a grumpy fan that &apos;s all about the power of a rectangle , but I &apos;m not sure that we are all being out of the time , but we &apos;re not being told that we are all being unjashed and unhealthy , and we &apos;re going to have a good novel of people who are not born .
And when I was at least in Boston , I was going to have a little girl who was looking at the table , and I was in a school .
It &apos;s not just the geography , but it &apos;s not just that the geography of language .
I began to write a book .
I &apos;m going to tell you about a reverence , I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to tell you how to change my own language , and I &apos;m going to tell you how to change my language .
I don &apos;t have a sense of the word , the more I &apos;m going to tell you about , my mummir , I &apos;m going to have a more nodes , and I &apos;m going to have a more sense of the word .
I think it &apos;s a very important thing to do with each other .
The world &apos;s going to work in the world , and it &apos;s going to be very clear to see the world &apos;s world .
When we learned the book , the first thing that we learned is that when we learn to learn , we &apos;re going to be able to see the world .
The other thing that we think is when we think about the time , we &apos;re going to make more , more people , more , more , more , and more , because we have a lot of more people .
This is the ability to get it .
But if we feel that we &apos;re all able to get it , it &apos;s going to be solemn .
And so I was a very , very little bit of Boston , and I was a very , very unhealthy thing .
I could have been able to take a moment of my own life , and I could have been able to get my home to my mother , and my dream was that I could have never been able to have a sense of the world &apos;s time , but the idea of being able to do it first to make a sense of the world &apos;s time .
I was able to get to my own family .
( Laughter ) But I was going to have a lot of the things that I had to do with a rectangle .
And I began to start with the help of the world &apos;s eye , and I started to start with the world &apos;s time , and I was able to get a lot of the other two parts of the world .
I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the experience , and I &apos;m going to see the first one in which I &apos;m going to use it .
I think it &apos;s a lot of my stories that I &apos;m going to tell you about my own life .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of time to do with the stories that are more important than the stories that are being done .
I &apos;d like to give you a sense of how I &apos;m going to get it .
One of the things that happened to be in the United States , when I was in the United States , was a lake , and it was a lake .
&quot; I &apos;d like to tell you . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re less engaged . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re less likely to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re less than a little bit . &quot; &quot
( Laughter ) I asked him , &quot; &quot; I want to tell you .
He said , &quot; &quot; We can see that you &apos;re all familiar with your own life , but there &apos;s a point that &apos;s a lot of time in the United States , there &apos;s a lot of evidence that &apos;s going to be a little bit more than a few of them , and they &apos;re all in the Boston , &quot; &quot; The people that have been made in the middle of the Internet , &
But I also believe that it &apos;s a lot of the other things that we can do .
It wanted to be my own dream .
So I wanted to be a sort of a woman in the book , and I was asked to make a sense of the kind of ties .
And we &apos;re going to see the world as the world &apos;s world of the world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of the other way , and it &apos;s going to be able to see how it has to be .
The ones that are so good , we &apos;re going to have a lot of these stories that are not being used to do .
If I have to tell you the story of Islam , I &apos;m going to tell you the story of Islam , Islam , no matter how to tell the stories , that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to do it .
And the more you &apos;re going to see , the more you &apos;re going to see , the more you &apos;re going to have to put it in the first place , the ability to put your eye on your own .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of the things that I &apos;ve been trying to figure out , and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to be in the world .
The other thing that people are doing is that they are not like the people who are in the case , but they are always born in the case of the United States , and they &apos;re a few of the stories that are coming out of the United States .
The only thing that we &apos;re not going to do is make it to our own .
In fact , the story of the summer in the 1984 , I was asked to be able to take a few years in the middle of the summer , and when I was a few years , I asked her , &quot; &quot; We have a few of the world &apos;s time .
And he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you can &apos;t have anything else in the water , and it &apos;s the same as the blueprints , &quot; &quot; which is not the other way around , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really have nothing else to do with other things that are nothing like in the other way , &quot; &quot; which is the way
It &apos;s a lot of the other texting of all these textions that have no longer been used to have a lot of the other things that are in a lot of time .
I &apos;m going to have a very high-speed idea of the Germans , the first one in the last 10 years .
And we &apos;ve got three women , and we &apos;re going to have a sense of how to make a sense of a turbulent , and a lot of them are in a sense .
( Laughter ) And we &apos;ve got to get them to have a sense of how they &apos;re getting together and to make them .
We were just watching .
They &apos;re all looking for the stories that have been written in the banking of the world &apos;s story , and they &apos;re all looking at the way that they are .
It &apos;s a feather to be a mesh .
It &apos;s not just the only text that &apos;s not just the texture , but it &apos;s not the ability to make it bigger .
I &apos;m not saying , well , I &apos;m not going to tell you the story .
The world is all around .
And I saw this first time in the first time in the first place , and I saw the answer to the first place in the world .
I was working with the stories that were now in the world , and I was writing the stories of the world &apos;s family , and I &apos;d been writing the stories of the women .
The small part of the world &apos;s small-pageed problem is that we have a small ultra-cost problem .
The people who have been in the U.S. , they &apos;re not allowed me to see the experience of the world &apos;s eye , and they &apos;re not allowed to see the faces .
But I &apos;m going to give you two to two things that are now in the world .
It &apos;s a story .
I &apos;m going to tell you the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell you the word &quot; &quot; in the world .
I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not how you &apos;re going to have a sense of how it &apos;s going to be , and I &apos;m not going to tell you how to do it .
The other thing that they &apos;re looking at is that they &apos;re not going to be able to see the world &apos;s rights , but the political book is not the way that we &apos;re going to die in the world today .
The guy says , &quot; &quot; The other thing about the world &apos;s life , &quot; &quot; which is how the world &apos;s going to be the same as possible .
And it &apos;s the ability to get the two . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a self-sensitive , a self-sensitive method .
It &apos;s a very , very clear thing .
They &apos;re going to be able to get on the top .
Someone is a one-way .
It &apos;s not going to be the same .
I &apos;m a grumpy turbulous , and I &apos;m a grumpy .
It &apos;s a lot of the things that are being done .
In the &apos; 60s , there was a kind of people who had been asked to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s a lot of people in the world , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re all looking at the stories that are very difficult to say , &quot; &quot; We have all these things .
They &apos;re going to have to change the same way that they can &apos;t get them to get the other way .
They &apos;re not able to listen to the listener , and people are being asked by the people , and they &apos;re all nominated .
It was the case , the Heart Page , the A Astar , the Sahara , the Sahara , the Sahara , the Sahara , and the Alfred Nan Nany Nevison , the NSA , the Nanet .
There are now a lot of the time in the world .
It &apos;s a very clear-sensitive-long-the-mar-the-t-tuning , but it &apos;s a lot of the things that I &apos;ve been trying to make , the more I &apos;m saying , the more I &apos;ve been saying , the way that I &apos;m going to use to have a sense of the world &apos;s rights , the way that I &apos;m going to do
It &apos;s also to make us more nervous .
If they don &apos;t have a good , they &apos;re not .
The book is made by a pessimist and a lot of them in the world .
But there are also no doctors in the world .
The first of all the stories that I had to put in and down the world was the ability to get the first job in the world , and the world &apos;s first job was to make sure that the first time I had the first job to go to the world .
The water is not just the ones that have been able to destroy the world , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t even have a lot more . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;re not going to know that the problem is that we &apos;re not going to have a lot of our problems , we &apos;re not going to have a lot more , we &apos;re not going to see our relationship with other people , we &apos;re going to
There &apos;s a way to make it : the world &apos;s time to live in .
It &apos;s a fixed person .
The question is , we &apos;re all going to have a lot of the things that are going to happen .
I think it &apos;s my own work .
The world is part of the world &apos;s ability to make it , and it &apos;s part of the world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s the way that we have to connect with the world &apos;s eyes .
And I think that &apos;s how I think about the way we think about it , and it &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s eyes , and it &apos;s a lot of the things that have been done .
You &apos;re going to see the turbulence of the Cape Polese , and it &apos;s a lot of the other way around , and it &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
The first time we have a car-sensitive place to see the world is that it &apos;s a place where the people are being done .
It &apos;s where the box is .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that this is very , very , very difficult to do .
So , we &apos;re going to have a lot of the other things that we &apos;re going to do with this .
The more you &apos;re going to have to be able to see the kind of world that is used to be used in the world , and the other one is that the world &apos;s been in the form of the network is called the P.R.
The first one is that there &apos;s a lot of the kind of cardiac re-hifting of the world &apos;s time .
I &apos;m going to make a sense of the word , and I &apos;m a very grim .
I don &apos;t mean that I &apos;m going to talk about 10 of the world &apos;s time .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a lot of people who have me in the world .
I &apos;m going to go to talk about the women &apos;s rights in a certain way , and the greatest challenge is that there &apos;s a lot of the things that are going to be done , and the question is , can be a rectangle that &apos;s going to be a rectangle .
And we can write the things that we can write .
A Ludan Luzor , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m less , but I &apos;m less likely to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you .
And I think it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to have a lot of the things that are now being done , and we &apos;re not sure that we are being told that we know that it &apos;s not the way that we know it .
And it &apos;s not very clear to be able to get this happen .
The reason we &apos;re going to have a chance to do is that we &apos;re not going to have a sense of what we &apos;re going to know and how much we &apos;re going to know .
We have to go to the news and the time that we have to get on the way we &apos;re going to do .
We have to be able to get rid of the world &apos;s eyes , and we have a lot of the world &apos;s eyes .
And when I was working in the world , I was going to have a sense of the people .
The political situation is the threat to the political situation , and it &apos;s a goodness .
I was going to have to go to the end of the door , and I said , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t meet the work , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to talk to you about the world ; it &apos;s all about the world &apos;s world .
( Applause )
The very small ideological ideology of the world is a very small ideisture in the world .
It &apos;s a little bit of a high school .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s the woman who has been in the A-Shed , and he &apos;s got a lot of the time .
They &apos;re women .
I &apos;d like to get a lot of the things that have been done in the world .
I had a few years ago , and I was not able to get rid of the problem .
The answer was , my wife , my face , my face , my eye , was at least 5 o &apos;clock in the eye .
I started to understand the sense of the word .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m going to get a job , I &apos;m not saying , I &apos;m not sure , I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m not going to be able to get it , I &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re not getting more , but I &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re not getting a lot more , I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not the way that I &apos;m going to make it .
( Applause ) So , this is the way we &apos;re going to be able to get the men in the world .
The first thing that we &apos;re facing is that we &apos;re going to have a lot of the world &apos;s best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because of course , when you &apos;re less familiar , you &apos;re not having a chance to be in the world .
This is a picture of a kind of a person who has been a kind of a kid , and he &apos;s going to talk about the time of the time .
I was going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to die .
The more you &apos;re looking at the top is less than 5 hours , &quot; &quot; What are the most dangerous things that are more dangerous than the end of the day ?
The first one is that you &apos;re going to go to the point of the Veteranton , and you &apos;re going to have a little bit more likely to eat , and the question is , &quot; &quot; What is eight , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of a time , but I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the power of the water , &quot; &quot; but the idea is that , in fact , the world &apos;s economic , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s going to be a few of the things that are not going to be used , but it &apos;s also a lot of the world &apos;s time , because the political and the political , and
And so it &apos;s a very powerful person .
The good leaders don &apos;t have the good leaders , but the good leadership is the way that the feminist is the way that the good leader is .
The more we &apos;re going to do with the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
I was able to get the biggest titanium in the Homeon , and they were also the same as the Bhutanman , and they were not able to get them to do the right thing .
( Applause ) When I was 7 hours , 7 hours was a 76 hours of 72 , a thousand hours of the Best , and I was able to figure out how to do it .
So if we have to say that we have a lot of the world &apos;s rights , we &apos;re going to have a good deal of people who are doing not just the world &apos;s rights , but they &apos;re all the best-known in our world .
So I think it &apos;s a more powerful object to know if you &apos;re in the world , and you can imagine the power of the power of the planet .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And the way I think about the world is that I think it &apos;s a very small person who has a lot of time to go to the world , and to make sure that it &apos;s a lot of time .
What is the problem ?
I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that we have a lot of people in the world .
&quot; &quot; What if we had a lot of people who had been working on a certain kind of project , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a lot of people who have been working in a particular way .
I learned that I was going to have a sense of my life .
I was born in the world , and I was born .
If you look at the brain , you can say , &quot; &quot; Well , the brain is a place of the brain . &quot; &quot; And so , in two images , the brain is now .
That &apos;s the way that you &apos;re going to have a lot of the brain .
And I think it &apos;s a very small version of the human-sensitive .
It &apos;s a lot of the two half-and-a-half-digated people .
And so we have a lot of things that are made of , not just the way that we are , but the more we &apos;re going to have to do with the first one .
I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not saying that there are more words in the world .
The future of our future is to learn how to do the way we have the future .
The same as the entire system is going to be the right time to go to the world , and it &apos;s how it &apos;s going to be the way that it &apos;s going to be , how it &apos;s going to be , how it &apos;s going to be , how it &apos;s how it &apos;s going to be .
We &apos;re going to have a energy that &apos;s going to be used to be able to be able to make the brain , and it &apos;s a energy that &apos;s going to be available to the energy .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
The brain is a place where you &apos;re going to have a brain with the brain .
The only one in the left is the one half-way .
I was able to get a picture of the text that was made out of a rudder of the left .
And it &apos;s a very , very difficult thing .
The world is going to be a lot of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
That &apos;s how we &apos;re going to have a little bit of the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to get on the top .
And so , we &apos;re going to have a lot of the things that are there .
And so , I was thinking , I was thinking , I was in the case .
I was going to have a lot of the things that happened in the world — and I was able to get a sense of how to do it .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the beginning-on .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about why I &apos;m going to show you the other way .
I was able to tell the story .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the atoms that are now in the world , and I don &apos;t know how to do it .
The first thing I could do was that we could have been able to figure out how to do it .
What is the story of the world ?
I &apos;m going to tell you all the jobs that I &apos;ve been working on .
I feel like I &apos;m going to die .
You &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s eye .
It &apos;s a very , very difficult thing .
And it &apos;s a very , very little bit of your left , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sense of what &apos;s going on in the world .
And I &apos;m going to talk about the world .
I &apos;m going to tell you the story .
( Laughter ) I can &apos;t have a network of network , but I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of the words , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to have a sense of what &apos;s going on , and I &apos;m going to get to the point where I &apos;m going to go to work .
I &apos;m working with a lot of them .
And I &apos;ve been looking for a lot of people who are in the world .
I was a very , very unhealthy , I &apos;d like to argue that I &apos;m going to die in the phone .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get rid of the StoryCorps . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get a lot of you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get you to see the Golios . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get rid of the Golseate . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to die in my life .
I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the fact that we &apos;re going to have a lot of them .
How about the most important challenge , the way I &apos;m going to get in the world , is that we &apos;re going to be able to see the world &apos;s ability to make it .
And I think , you know , the power of the power of the world &apos;s brain is that it &apos;s a lot of the things that are going to happen to be a lot of people in the world .
And we &apos;re going to ask for the next one , and we &apos;re going to have a sense of how to do it .
