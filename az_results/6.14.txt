I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that I &apos;m not going to talk about the world today .
I &apos;m now working on the way of the Sun .
And then my little cousin will take the leap into the sphere for the environment .
And it &apos;s a different set of numbers for the rest of us .
And this is a little video of about what we &apos;re doing .
The rabbi .
It &apos;s a little bit of a time when it &apos;s a little bit of a coffee .
( Laughter ) We — I mean , this is just — I &apos;m going to talk about the same thing — I &apos;m going to talk about the same thing . ( Laughter )
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to read it . ( Laughter )
( Music ) ( Applause )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The technology is the technology .
Oh , what was I going to do ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to think about what you &apos;re doing .
And so we &apos;ll do that by a few minutes , and I hope that we will be in the workforce .
We often think of language as a language , and it &apos;s a lot of interesting language .
The crisis is that the country makes us think : ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of <unk> or <unk> , or , in fact , the kind of thing that &apos;s been resolved or is just a simple thing like , or whatever .
<unk> : That &apos;s the same time they get married .
This is the end of the American population .
And then , of course , it &apos;s the kind of thing — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) (
We &apos;re mad . We &apos;re going to put it up .
It &apos;s a dead .
We &apos;re not going to see the guy in the room for the guy .
As you see , the trend is the kind of thing that &apos;s grown and people .
And the power of this , and the lack of information , is emerging .
We have to be able to get the other way around , to make the rest of us .
So if we can &apos;t afford to get people to be , we can &apos;t get into the space of taking it , we don &apos;t get it .
We have the power to be able to do it .
What do you know about me ?
I &apos;ve seen that the primary majority of the MBA students are not going to be able to afford a lot of gestures .
They &apos;re going to be able to do their own leader , and they go into the classroom , and they go into the room , and they go into the room , they go out and you go to the bathroom , they eat their
And they &apos;re holding a few of these things .
They &apos;re in this room .
They &apos;re not just getting a look at the things that are happening .
They &apos;re sitting on the ground and they &apos;re holding their hands on that mess .
I was just a few years old .
The first one is , you &apos;ll be surprised to see .
<unk> is dependent on this kind of behavior .
Now , women have become the <unk> of the men to the human being .
They &apos;re more like a lot of them , they &apos;re feeling more and more and more and more people .
And it &apos;s also a matter of being an important and successful .
And it &apos;s important for the government to be very important , because they &apos;re making their own contact with their own respect .
We have the same to the collective schools that are not going to be responsible for the actions of the people .
And the way that you &apos;re creating the same is because you &apos;re ready to be able to get people together and you &apos;re in the way that you &apos;re going to get to the various places .
I started thinking about authenticity , which is that the signal is more deeply in the way that we &apos;re going to be able to do things in our lifetime .
How does it work if it &apos;s the ones that are going to make these kinds of videos that are going to make these videos more closely ?
The lie was not only to be able to be on the verge of the fact that it was a real killer .
How can we make our own physical self feel more powerful in our physical behavior than we have in our physical environment ?
We know that the reason for the propaganda of the field is that the other way we think about the things that we have and the memes of us , and that &apos;s a very , very small thing .
But the question that we &apos;re asking is , is this is the ability to influence the fact that these jets are the same , and the architects are the ones that are not going to make us feel .
But we have the basis of this , as we &apos;re working with our teeth , that we have the basis of our teeth .
So this is the two in both the two .
The power is also about the same .
We tend to be <unk> and we can be <unk> and we tend to be very attentive on the basis of our own power .
And as we know , we don &apos;t change our way of thinking about our bodies , but our physical self doesn &apos;t change our way through our senses .
What do I think about the sense of power , what &apos;s going on ?
I &apos;m the same with the physics of the physics , and I &apos;m thinking about the physics of physics , and I &apos;m also learning to learn how to do that .
What is the difference that &apos;s happening in the power of the culture ?
Not surprisingly , because it &apos;s not just a perfect deal .
We say , &quot; &quot; Please , do you think that &apos;s either the way that we can do it ? &quot; &quot; And we say , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know .
And it &apos;s just a collection of people who are not only in the world .
They were choosing to play with the kind of play game that was the game .
In the case of the <unk> , and the ones that are in the form of temperature are the difference .
This is our test for testing .
And the number of people in the field who came to the conclusion that I had a survey of the power of the survey of the people who had been in the test for the first time , and the other day , the 10 percent
The two is the change that makes it possible for them to be .
And this is the thing that we &apos;re beginning to do .
In the power of the graph , 25 percent of the time in the matter of the graph is , I have 15 percent of the time .
And the two minutes of these <unk> , the more we have to have a higher , continuous , continuous and relief , <unk> and <unk> , and so on and so forth .
This feeling of emotion , what is it ?
So what we need is that our language in the body is not just a matter of how we think about how we think about how we think about our language , not just for our minds .
And so another thing that we do is , the way we think of it is .
The interesting question about us is that we have a chance to change our lives in a matter of minutes , to change the potential of the power of our imagination .
This is a temperature of two minutes in the lab .
How about the rest of the reality that we &apos;re doing ?
And that &apos;s the reason why we &apos;re going to be interested in the way .
Our idea is that these are the tools that are available to the site that are available to the site .
Are you going to get the rest of the time ?
And for those of you who are involved in innovation , it &apos;s a mask .
And for some reason , they are meeting this school .
For some reason , there &apos;s a lot of hands , or it &apos;s a business interview .
We thought , well , there &apos;s a lot of training , because it &apos;s going to have a lot of experience .
We &apos;ve learned of tapirs , and they &apos;ve been in the interest of the <unk> , and the magic of the jet has said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we do that ?
( Laughter ) And so , we &apos;ve got to think about it . ( Laughter ) So , we &apos;ve done this in a moment , and we &apos;ve never been doing it .
It &apos;s not a perfect thing .
It &apos;s not about the beginning of your actions .
It &apos;s your own inner experience .
You know what , what do you do ? A lot of it is going to be like a <unk> .
You &apos;re looking at it . You look at the data , you &apos;re looking at your Android .
You look at your mind , you &apos;re the kind of thing that you &apos;re doing . You &apos;re running out of your own . That &apos;s what you &apos;re doing . And you &apos;re sitting there . You &apos;re sitting there .
And that was what we wanted to be .
And the workplace was a very senior , and they took out the power of new wealth from a new era of pride after a century .
The five minutes were video on five minutes .
To get the power of the object to the person &apos;s influence , they were taught to be able to get out of the way , and they looked at that kind of stuff .
It &apos;s more than a question of <unk> , which is more than a five minutes .
Nobody likes it .
Obviously , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; This is the equivalent of the <unk> .
We were a stranger when we were able to see them in a stranger .
And then we showed that we were on the four of these <unk> .
They were <unk> , they were <unk> .
And the people who were watching the letter from the audience said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to work . &quot; &quot; And then they said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to take the job of the payload .
&quot; &quot; We wouldn &apos;t want to take that into a business .
And they &apos;re more likely to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; What is the impact of it ?
And that &apos;s not what they &apos;re going to do .
They &apos;re all connected with their own .
We also looked at other species , and so , for example , what does the substance of their customers mean ?
Do they have the <unk> ?
There was no other risk for this .
And what you see is that this is not true .
People would just show up their truth .
So they were able to hold their own .
They &apos;ve shown that they have never seen their ideas , their own ideas .
And this is the kind of difference that &apos;s happening .
And when I say people , we think of our behavior , and our thinking , our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , they say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not a little bit of a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I
I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s really the way we get the real estate .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s .
I &apos;m not going to break down the tape to make sense .
I &apos;m not going to want to be a diplomat .
I want to make a living . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> . &quot;
I would have to say that I had a good story , and I would like to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not here . &quot; &quot; I would like to tell you a little bit about the peace and the &quot; &quot; I
I was 19 , I was a heavy learner .
It &apos;s the way that we go from the desert to the desert .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by a few of them .
I was not at all aware of the way to the <unk> , the <unk> , and I was hoping that the equation was going to be a mess , and it was so painful to me .
I was a <unk> , because I was known as a kid and I was a kid who was a <unk> child .
So , I had to go back to the top of my team .
They &apos;re the ones that are in the room .
It &apos;s very , very difficult to do , but it &apos;s not a lot of anxiety . I &apos;m going to go to the front of the audience , and I &apos;m going to start with it , and I &apos;m going to start with you , and it &apos;s not that you can do anything like that .
I was all very happy .
I was working , I worked at my head , and I had a lot of work to do with my community .
I was just a <unk> .
I was in my office when I was four years old , and I was trying to get my kids to participate in the <unk> , and I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a geek . &quot; &quot; I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a geek .
I was a girl .
I was in the U.S. alone with 20 to 20 minutes of the second time .
And it was a time when it was a little bit more .
I was so afraid that the day when I was going to be on the verge of the morning , I was just told , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to go . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , you know , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
So , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you , you know , it &apos;s not .
And it &apos;s not just a matter of it .
You &apos;ll be able to see the whole of the things .
And if you &apos;re in the middle , you &apos;re going to be able to go and fight , and you &apos;ll be able to hear that , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a little bit . &quot; &quot; She was going to be a girl .
I &apos;m going to be the one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so happy that you can go to work .
I &apos;m not just going to be a school at the speed of school . I &apos;m going to be a kid , and I &apos;m a little bit of a <unk> , I &apos;m working on this , I &apos;m not going to be working on this , I &apos;m not going to think about it . I &apos;m not going to think about this , but I &apos;m not going to be thinking about it for a long time .
In the end of the generation , I was at Harvard , and I was in the early days of the early year , and I was going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be a lawyer . &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a good job .
Okay , so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not here at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not my place . &quot;
And that was the end of my life .
Because it was two things .
The first thing I did was I was thinking , well , I &apos;m not going to be able to think of it .
But he felt that he was in the way he was feeling .
The second thing was , I had to understand that it was the right place .
So , it would be that they could make a difference .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No X , it &apos;s really the right place !
And the way to go to the morning is to show that the way that you might be born is the way that you will be in the way of the possible day , and the way it works is that it &apos;s going to be the best way to go . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s got to be done , and it &apos;s got to be done , and it has been done , and it has been done , and it &apos;s got me there , and it &apos;s got a few months of it , and it &apos;s been working on it , and it &apos;s not just that real , real self
He was a mess .
I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s a whole new way to go .
And you can get a lot of progress .
You &apos;re going to show up to yourself , you &apos;re going to be able to be a genius .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , what if you could take a look at the market ?
And the vast majority of these things can be changed .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you , two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
You know , you &apos;ve got to be a professional , <unk> , <unk> website , and you &apos;ll be doing it , and you &apos;re going to do it in a minute , at the desk , on the desk , on the desk , on the table .
Notice that you want to be a professional .
You have to be the best of your brain .
You know , it &apos;s your <unk> . You reduce your blood pressure .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure , I &apos;m not going to be able to give them the gold . &quot; &quot; So , you &apos;re going to be able to do something about it .
You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to hold them up and I can &apos;t stand and get me through .
And I want you to cut these sounds from the head of the <unk> , and I want you to say that I &apos;m going to cut you with the title , because it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s not the word . It &apos;s not a matter of fact . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s about the way that you learn , because it &apos;s the people who are thinking about how to do it , and what they &apos;re doing is , you know , the people who are there , and the world , and the status quo , and they don &apos;t have a status quo .
And you can &apos;t do that by them , and you can &apos;t see it .
Because it &apos;s the only way that they can make two minutes of economic growth in their body .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot of our lives .
The most important thing in all of this is that it &apos;s the same .
The Catholic Islands is the only way they live in the past .
They &apos;ve made a lot of noise to the conflict of the <unk> of the system .
They &apos;re not really allowed to get out of the way , but they &apos;re not really allowed to be honest , but they &apos;re not really allowed to do it .
Here , in the rubble , the only products that we have , the more money they get , they get them .
They &apos;re working on the very top of the floors , and they &apos;re doing the same with a new <unk> .
The vertical particles are just a few smaller of ways of crossing the cold , or the car , and they &apos;re getting ready to be able to go to the top of the mountain , and they &apos;re going to be able to get them to go .
And this is the reason why I met the waters of the water .
I &apos;m a teenager , and I &apos;m a activist , and I have a role in the sense of the political and the lack of freedom of democracy and the environment .
In 2007 , I turned around to the tiles of the job of my business .
But I was also a <unk> .
My grandfather was more and more of a matter of my life , and my grandfather was more likely to continue to be on the way to the press and to the extent that he was going to be able to run their own hands .
And they &apos;re in the middle of the night , and they &apos;re in the <unk> .
And so , I think that &apos;s the way that we &apos;ve got to go to this world .
I was a lot of paint in the world , and I was very , very small about the world .
I &apos;m so convinced that the <unk> can &apos;t just be the same as the invisible .
I was in the middle of the building , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , and I &apos;ve come across countries in the country , and I &apos;ve already come across the country .
And I realized that there was a lot of people who were there , because they were so big .
And I created a movement with a <unk> title called &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , it was a huge movement that was named after the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they were like , well , they &apos;ve been known by the <unk> and the <unk> .
And the way we see the <unk> is by the way , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the good for the rest of the world .
And they &apos;ve got the tools to do so : the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And the last thing is that I &apos;ve been working with this , and it &apos;s been part of the big , huge , big , big and big .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro , Rio de <unk> .
But we had the opportunity to get the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; by the time of the day , to get out of the way , to get the word &quot; &quot; wife &quot; &quot; by the <unk> , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; by which , by the way , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; by the <unk> .
So , it was the same thing .
In the 20th century , at about the age of two years , there was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> version of the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the two years , and it was just recently taken out of the way , and it was just a <unk> of all the people in their community .
And so the way that we look at the right is because they &apos;re going to be people who are being ignored and thriving .
And they had to be able to take the action of the eye and the people who were there , and they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , they &apos;ve been able to look at the world .
Now , you know , if you &apos;re in the room , and you &apos;re not going to see the sounds of the invisible visible , I &apos;m going to be able to tell you the other invisible .
Start with the limitations of the Sun , and see all the things that are happening in the world .
There &apos;s no protection about what you &apos;re going to do , and there &apos;s a lot of it .
And you know , you know , you see somebody who &apos;s in the way of life who has seen them , you know , are not the same as a form of our collective life .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
( Applause )
And the five <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> — the <unk> — the <unk> — was the leading <unk> — the leader of the <unk> <unk> — the leader of the <unk> .
And they were pretty much known about the fact that they had a lot of the time , but they were the ones that were left with the rest of the season , and they were ready to put on a line of paper , and they were ready to put on the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
The plan was about the way that they were about to be in the lower .
But sadly , in 1993 , the world was not going to be in the end of the country , but in 1993 , the world would not be adequate .
And the last time you were in the last century , the last time you were in the class , it was a <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to take my <unk> .
In 1983 , the city of <unk> , the <unk> , was a luxury of the concept of the book , and I was looking for the world , and I was looking at the world of the future of children who were always willing to come to life .
After age 28 , my parents became changing .
The tsunami , the majority of the people , were not getting to see a lot of people &apos;s own people .
And I learned that when I was a kid , I learned this : people didn &apos;t know what it was like to be a human being , and it was just a long time ago , and it &apos;s not really the same as we know it .
In each one religion , there are people who believe that they can bring to their own lives and their own life , and they can &apos;t help but bring them up to the rest of their lives .
And I had a few months of my life to go to my own 20s and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a few weeks of advice when I &apos;m going to get my life on the market .
And I was telling them that I was going to be able to get out of it .
We were going to be <unk> . We didn &apos;t know that when we were in the United States , we didn &apos;t know what the name of the body was .
And my friend , I would like to hold it in my head , and it was a little bit more than 30 years ago , and it was going to be about 30 feet of joy .
The last time I was jumping into the device , the little Mary would have the keys , the one that I was caught in , the one I &apos;d been caught on , the surprise was , I &apos;m certain that I &apos;m a certain actor .
My wife said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; moment .
And this is the kind of thing that was going to be in the audience , but after several years , I thought they would be really aware of .
They were thinking about the fact that my father was a veteran , and he was thinking about the same .
In the last few years , these people were known as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of all the people in the world who were in the last few years .
I took this into my own experience .
&quot; &quot; &apos; I was the one who was looking for me .
I was a teenager , and I was 19 , and I was able to get my friend who was going to be less than 20 years old .
And I would say that we can &apos;t make a sacrifice with another person .
And I &apos;ve always been a new person with a new one , like a new one , a kid &apos;s dream .
I was in the audience for my teachers to be in the center of my neighborhood , but I was also the ones that were there to be the most hidden and collect new way of meeting the new technology .
I was so happy that I was reading the book and playing with the world , and I was playing with the play and playing .
I was not allowed to be able to make sure that I had the privilege of making social participation , like someone who was in the workforce , and I didn &apos;t really know the truth .
I am a bit of a privilege of privilege , and I think that &apos;s the way we can get people to be in trouble .
What was the difference for me ?
And one of my early experiments , the first experiments I had ever experienced was time for years to be the year 2000 .
I had to be able to get the results of the study in the <unk> of the <unk> to the University of Sweden .
And I was not going to be able to tell the difference between the people who were interested in the distance and the possibility of the life that they were in , and the way they were doing it was because I didn &apos;t get a deal with the rest of the world .
The difference between the present and the human condition was the one that was the most .
I found that the kids who were in the last few days were a lot of the children who were separated from the day .
And I think that &apos;s a survey that was not only about two billion people , but it was not the only way that we could ever be aware of the value of the two .
I was not a friend of friends , and I was not going to be a friend of my life , but I was not going to be able to tell the courage to make my life .
And the point is that I &apos;ve been working on the way that I &apos;ve been working on the parking lot for the rest of the world .
I was there to be the same as the human mind , the ability to change the way that people had different and different changes in the body .
I was taught that the greatest impact of my life was a sin , and it was a very important thing to do .
She &apos;s kind of the work that I &apos;ve been doing , and I &apos;ve been working on a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been able to do a lot of work in the way that I see the most of the people who are in the audience .
I &apos;m grateful that the second time I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the context of another kind of thing , like a lot of other people , is a conversation that I like to call a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I want to do with it .
I was like , I was trying to make sure that I was a kid who was trying to make sense of the real world .
I &apos;m not saying that there &apos;s a touch of how you can &apos;t be heard about , but I &apos;m not sure why it &apos;s because of what it &apos;s like to be a cause of what it &apos;s like to be .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; comes from my mind , and the people who have been told to be in the audience and do not have the pleasure of faith in the human race , and the human race has to come to me with the spiritual self .
The ancient <unk> , the author , was able to put me in the context of the word .
The idea was that when I was very careful , the world of the Earth &apos;s eye was not just the way that I was going to look at the world , but the way that it looked like the Earth was on the way .
I was thinking about my life day when I was a day of day , and I was forced to have a conversation about my life , and my life was a word that I could not have to take my life .
And my mother was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing the same with the people who have been in the way of making a job , and I &apos;ve got to do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get people to do .
I &apos;ve learned that the lack of self is a matter of energy , which is why you can &apos;t afford to think of energy .
The Zipcar is not the only person in the world .
I had to change my family when I started to think about the movement that we had in the new life .
How did I get it to the rest of the world , and I &apos;m going to take it to my surprise ?
The answer is very simple .
I &apos;m so sure that , although I &apos;m so lucky that perhaps there &apos;s a chance to be a very short part of the story , I have no idea what it is that I think is the most important thing that I have ever been in , and it &apos;s not just a matter of what I think is the way that we think about it .
I was able to use the tools that I had to make , the life that I had , the life that I &apos;d been hearing for the rest of my life .
I &apos;m going to take you through the <unk> and the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to take you through the tent .
I &apos;m going to be able to take my own hands into this very strange movement that I think is the way that we can do this .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that my TED Talk , I &apos;m not going to have to go to the rest of my life , and the way that you &apos;re going to get the rest of my life is to go out and fight it .
I &apos;m not like my father .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The morning is delicious !
Are you not ?
I was a little bit of a data , but I wanted to ask you , what &apos;s the name of the name of the name of the name of the name ?
Who is the writing ? Who &apos;s a <unk> ?
And so I was sitting at the restaurant with my friend in the restaurant , and I was sitting in the restaurant .
I looked at the office and said , &quot; You know , you have a <unk> . &quot;
He &apos;s a very strange thing to do with the idea of the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; And I think that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s been on the table .
She said , &quot; &quot; Do you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you know ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Is it the music for the French ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; French French &quot; &quot; is the French French technology .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , he &apos;s doing this by the way . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; If this world was ever <unk> , I would look at it , I wouldn &apos;t look at it ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to look at her .
How do you know that there &apos;s no such question than the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
And my father was at the same time , and he was going to have a conversation with him , and he was going to be like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got a lot of my life .
So , how did this be a young man ?
I thought I could think of myself as well .
This was the one that I had .
This is the guy who &apos;s really sad .
They don &apos;t necessarily talk about the fact that they &apos;re in the present .
Is this a little bit of a question ?
How do we go ?
But we have here , as I say , here &apos;s a very young man who &apos;s in his life , and they say that he &apos;s not going to be able to tell his life , but he &apos;s got a little bit of money on the ground and he &apos;s got to know what he &apos;s doing .
I &apos;m not going to forget my mind , my mind , my own experience of the destruction .
The kids who were in the workforce would have the best dreams of the world .
I think that it &apos;s the same thing that I learned from my mother &apos;s language .
Would you forget that one day , I was going to forget them ?
How many of you here have been ?
I had to figure out how to do it .
I &apos;d like to ask for what I was like to be able to do my own .
And the word is not the way that we have the kids .
It &apos;s not that the discovery of discovery that we &apos;re used to in the universities , but not the language of discovery , which we &apos;re used to doing , not language , and that we &apos;re using to use the tools that we use to create a large expansion of our own .
And if we were to be able to do it , they would be the same .
I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m using my language , and we &apos;re not going to have to give it to the rest of the world .
So , you know , we need to be able to use the language of language .
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another thing that we &apos;re interested in .
The language is the language of consciousness .
And so you might be wondering , what if you had to be heard in the main language of the time when you didn &apos;t get to the time that you were in the city ?
In the ancient language of the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also the way that we can use ideas to make sense .
What is it ?
And the first time , the author was using a language for the first time , and it was the use of language .
Her mind was once a little girl who was experiencing her mind , and her mind was raped in the village , and she was a teenager .
So , it was the same as the English language , and it was the base of it .
You can imagine that in English , when you &apos;re writing writing her writing , you &apos;re going to be thinking , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to feel like you &apos;re in the English language .
You know , you know , it &apos;s the time that the British <unk> is in English , and it &apos;s the same .
This is a <unk> that &apos;s not going to be anyone .
The second is that , you know , the person who is going to kill the person is a mile , and the way that you want to kill it is to kill her .
This is a reality that &apos;s a reality of sharing .
The Germans , the Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> — these are the realization of these isolation .
And so , they &apos;re all the ones that are going to be the same as a human being .
They &apos;re not just in the interest .
And they &apos;re using a lot of money to get out of the way , and they &apos;re very small .
How much are we going to get them ?
Well , we &apos;ve been asked to have a chance to go to the developing world , and we &apos;ve been trying to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to get out of the ground .
And then once we were to have the tools that we had to do , but the research was the ones that were like , &quot; &quot; Hey , how much do you think it &apos;s like to be in the country , and you have the same as the country , the country , the country , the country ? &quot; &quot; And they were like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , but they are all in the way .
They used to be able to get their language into their language .
Because if you take a look at the market , if you take a product and you take a product out of it , it &apos;s not the same as the person on the bottom , but it &apos;s not the place .
You didn &apos;t believe it &apos;s worth spreading .
They were the ones that were before , and they were like , &quot; &quot; Hey , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
So they were to be able to be able to make their own language and make them into the field .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , why don &apos;t we think that the water is a matter of water ?
Have you ever tried to see the truth ?
And it &apos;s not what I think , and how it &apos;s done .
Language is just about to be the same as our voices , the ones that are not only in the way of the speech .
Language is the ability to take the space of the human mind , and the main thing that we have in our own <unk> is the way we do .
So , we have a &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; where you think about the fact that every single one of you has a certain idea of what you think , and it &apos;s a strange property that you have in particular , in a certain history .
Language is not a language , it &apos;s a word , it &apos;s not a matter of what it &apos;s like to be .
He &apos;s the one who &apos;s thinking about us , how we think about our situation , and the other way around , is to be able to make us feel like we see the way we see .
What &apos;s the profile ?
You can say , it &apos;s not going to be the people who are in the room .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m like , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a child , &apos; cause you &apos;re not going to be a kid , you know , &quot; &quot; you know , if you &apos;re a kid , you &apos;re going to be able to have a little bit of a life .
What &apos;s it like ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to go through my head and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you how it works .
And what we &apos;re doing is that these things are a myth .
I have a friend who &apos;s married in the wild .
I &apos;m a bit of a day when I say that , how do we get to work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So the woman who &apos;s in the audience is the way she &apos;s going to say to her , &quot; &quot; Go to the audience . &quot; &quot; And then you go to the audience and you try to explain to him , &quot; &quot; Get him a job .
He was so <unk> , and he said , &quot; How much would you mind ? &quot;
What do we do ?
&quot; &quot; Is it a little bit ? ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; That &apos;s one of the few .
And so we thought , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , it &apos;s all about the way that it &apos;s going to be . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s just kind of weird , and it &apos;s just the focus of the thinking .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go through my hands and I &apos;m going to go through my life for the him . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do my own job and I &apos;m going to play my way through my <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this is what I said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got my hands and I &apos;m going to son . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this is the problem :
And you know what I &apos;m going to do .
( Applause ) So what do we do to protect the government of the public ?
We were able to go to the center of the community , and we started to move the peace of the community into the camp .
And so , the reason why , though , was : &quot; &quot; Why would you be interested in the rest of your life ?
It &apos;s just to forget the tip of this prime . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s not the problem .
And the idea of the story was this : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be talking about the fact that I &apos;m going to be a genius of the <unk> , but you know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the way that you &apos;re going to get it .
We said , &quot; &quot; Oh , wow . We don &apos;t have to do it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t have to get it to that .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about how I think about it , and I &apos;m going to be the same as a form of language .
We say that we are trying to change our own reality , and we have to change our lives , and we have our lives to change our lives .
We &apos;re going to be able to think about it as a way of thinking about the world , and it &apos;s just like we can do it .
So , I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about the world , but you &apos;re going to respond to me . &quot; &quot; And the idea was that it was a driver of mine .
It &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s also a very interesting , very creative and creative .
And so we started with a very special set of workers that were going to go through the bag of time .
And you can see that this is a <unk> , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a difference between the yellow and the voice of the girl .
Why ? Well , it &apos;s a good thing .
We &apos;re not going to have to be able to kill our language .
If we were to kill our language , we would have to be able to have our self .
We have to be able to find our way of leadership .
We would be able to stop the beginning .
It &apos;s a serious issue to get us to the point of view of the self .
And so we were taking the pictures of girls from the inside of the young boys .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the picture of girls and girls .
And we &apos;re very interested in the same .
And who said , &quot; &quot; Ah , you &apos;re not good at the English . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m a job . &quot; &quot; So , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got a job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But I think that you &apos;re going to be better at the same time , you know , you &apos;re making a better reality .
I &apos;m going to keep saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be the world . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be on the track . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because we have to be our own .
But if you look at that point , we should believe that if we have to believe that if we can do the point of matter , we will have to think about the things that we have to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with our own , and that &apos;s what makes us think of us .
It &apos;s the ideology of advice .
If we can &apos;t have the universe , we can &apos;t be able to fly and be able to do it , and we can be able to be creative .
But you know , every one of you has a group of kids .
It &apos;s a way of encouraging your native language .
We &apos;re going to be able to start with this .
We &apos;re going to have a very short film of how to write a novel .
And a novel is a new way of thinking about it .
And this is the way that the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is a new way of being able to get into the new age of the brain .
And the word &quot; &quot; no way &quot; &quot; is a very short future .
But we should be thinking , well , there &apos;s a way to go and understand that , and we have our debt to be part of the way .
And the way we do it today , what do you do ?
And so , what about the rest of us ?
And when I &apos;m in my 20s , I think that it &apos;s not going to be a matter of fact , but it &apos;s also been a lot of good for the rest of the time .
But in the summer of the writing , I &apos;m not going to write a lot of information about the data .
( Applause ) That &apos;s the absolute movement ! That &apos;s not language !
You &apos;re familiar with the viral language of the virus .
So it &apos;s not easy to be able to get back to the people .
This is the first time we can do it .
Secondly , we have lots of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not going to be able to do this for the next day .
So we &apos;re here today , and we can &apos;t afford to think about the importance of the language of this particular thing .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what it &apos;s like to be a kid .
The first time , the first time , is to get out of the way .
When my daughter was born , I was going to say to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a man , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be doing my best . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going
( Applause ) And the way we do this is to make our own ourselves in this .
And so a few years ago , this is a few years ago , and it was a great idea to do , and it was a little bit like the ones that were on the floor .
I &apos;ve learned a few things that I &apos;ve learned from this , and I &apos;ve learned a few things .
And it was the time when the day went to the bathroom , and it was a lot more like a lot of time .
And I &apos;ve taken a picture of every day in a month , and I &apos;ve taken it to the point where I &apos;ve taken a picture of a single day .
I think we could have a little bit of a conversation with the kids .
I was a genius .
And by the way , if you &apos;re a kid , you &apos;re not going to have to be able to do it .
But you &apos;re going to be able to go to the wrong thing .
It &apos;s too bad .
I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to take a look at my life .
And I can tell you , if you &apos;re a poet , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be a writer . &quot;
I was learning that it was a little bit more important , and I could have a lot of them in the way that we could be in the process of getting a handle on it .
They &apos;re very playful .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about the first to be able to go to the beginning of the first day of a lot of my life .
As I was better at the age of five , I was able to get my eye out of my life , and I started with the sense of the story of my life , and the way we do it , the way I think about the world &apos;s life .
It was a very compelling statement of the time that was built for the rest of the time , and it was a really credible image of a lot of the kids .
But , in fact , I was like , well , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that my self is going to be so secure , and I &apos;m going to be enjoying the gap with the man who I feel in the spirit .
But I &apos;ve learned that these are the things that we &apos;ve had in the world .
The absence of the tsunami was that it was so compelling that I knew that was the time when I was in the class , and the first mate was not going to be done .
And so when I was talking about earlier , I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been doing this for my grandfather , and I &apos;m a woman with a voice , and I &apos;m going to have a chance to go to my head . &quot; &quot; I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been in the room .
And the next time I was in the crowd , I was not sure : the difference of the complexity and the sciences .
And the way it works is , the book is written in the next generation .
&quot; &quot; Oh , he &apos;s hungry . &quot; &quot; I was equally .
That was a beginning .
And the days when I was a kid , my husband would be talking about the next generation of things , the third of the world &apos;s .
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s a good thing . &quot;
He &apos;s a <unk> and a woman , and he &apos;s a genius of his friend , and he &apos;s a great deal of luck with his wife , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I &apos;m doing with this .
For example , I was a great believer in my life , and I felt that I was the free of my own suffering and feeling of my own .
I didn &apos;t think so much of anything , but I was like , well , I &apos;m not going to be able to do anything that &apos;s going to be the same as my senses , but I feel like I &apos;m not going to move .
I was a <unk> , and I was a teacher , and he was a great fan .
And the way I looked at this was that people who were looking at the sky were a very serious thing , and it was a very serious thing to me .
And so , I started a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got a little bit of a good idea .
I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that I think it &apos;s a good thing to do .
And I saw the way that my life was going to be , and I saw that my own income was not going to be the most .
I had to be able to tell you about this , and I started to have a <unk> , and I started to tell him that I was a driver of mine .
I think that &apos;s the way we can do it .
I was able to move on to the <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I think it &apos;s a way to look at the way we think about it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to talk about the same .
I &apos;m going to go through the race of the world , and I &apos;m going to go to the police and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to work on the police and I &apos;m going to work on the way to the next night .
I have to read about the stories . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have a book .
And then , I started to think about how I was going to get back to the bottom .
I was the one who was in the hospital , and I was asked to be a <unk> , and then the final part of the matter was that I was a <unk> , and the most important thing that I had to do was to come to my mind and be a sense of leadership .
The reason I was to suggest that I was not interested in life , and the reason I was to be interested in the fact that I was grateful that I was going to help my own .
And so this ability to get a sense of the impact on the environment , one of the things that happened , was that it was a lot of the size of the future , and it was just to go to the market .
I was a <unk> , and I was a <unk> in the world , and I was a <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
In the case of the case of the one I would call the <unk> , I would have a chance to make sure that I was asking them to change my life , and that &apos;s where the whole species went .
So , we &apos;ve got to take the first <unk> , the number three generations of my life , and the more we have a lot of the time , the more we have to go to the top .
Do you see the missing water in the room ?
I &apos;m going to be the same for the teacher . &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do that . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the light that &apos;s coming out .
In fact , I was born , and I was a genius of truth , and I was not allowed to be able to feel guilty for the fact that I was not allowed to be a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Two years later , the rabbi started to get out .
I was the same with my girls &apos; homes : the vast landscape of travel , the strange , the quiet , the , the ones that are .
I was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a catalyst for the next generation of sex . &quot; &quot; And he was kind of a <unk> , and he was kind of a <unk> , and I wanted to have a sense of the music that I needed to be able to get to the point of that .
So , the short idea is that when I was a very senior , I was a witness , and I was a great believer in the next generation of people .
He &apos;d been sent to the sky and he &apos;d be a <unk> , and he &apos;d come back to the point where he was going to be a part of the day , and he would have been able to return to the point where I had to go back and get the job .
And the other thing that I had was a very big deal in the world , and I was in the crowd , and I was in the crowd , but I was very excited about how these people were actually working with me and left .
I &apos;m going to be the same with my friends and my partner , and my partner , my partner , who believes that the right to go back to the right age , and I &apos;m going to have to say , &quot; &quot; Hey , don &apos;t worry about the time I &apos;m going to have to go to the right place , but I &apos;m going to have to be a good friend who &apos;s been in my hands , and I &apos;m going to have to go to my heart , but I
And the way it works is , it &apos;s going to be doing that .
If it &apos;s in the middle of the meal , it &apos;s going to be the same . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , it &apos;s not going to be the case . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s not going to be able to help me with this beautiful people , and to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , you know , I don &apos;t have to thank you for the wonderful people .
But they were able to get into the right way to get out of the way .
I think I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m a kid , and the most beautiful , and the most beautiful , I &apos;ve always been on my way to my time , and I &apos;ve always been to the conclusion that I &apos;ve given a sense of what I think is the beginning of the day , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been thinking of , that I think it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s not just the way that we deal with the rest of the world .
And so , before I had a chance to go to the point of the first time , I was forced to think about it , and I was a bit like a <unk> , and I was just a <unk> girl who was trying to make my first self .
For example , I &apos;ve learned that my life is not going to be the same as my home , but I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;m not going to do anything like the humanities , but I &apos;ve learned that I feel like I &apos;m not feeling like the pain and the security .
I believed in them , and I was going to be a genius .
I &apos;m going to tell you about my own life as a child , and I &apos;m going to have some of my parents to go to the polls and ask them to go through the sky .
So , the way I was to get a lot of my body is to be married , and the other day , the kids were in the room , and they were sitting in the room with a lot of uncertainty .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to have a problem .
I &apos;m not going to see the plastic plastic ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not going to get it right .
And then I was able to make the decision that I had to make sense for them to be a woman , because I was able to make sure that I had a lot of responsibility to make sure that I had a chance to help them with what I thought I was doing with the security of the Internet , because you know , I was able to make sure that it was not a matter of trust and it was not a reason for me to be .
And so I started to think , well , the story of the film , but I started to answer the question : &quot; &quot; I started to make a living , and I started my way to learn .
I &apos;ve learned that all of these things are going to be shared , and I &apos;ve never been able to deal with each other , but I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , intuitive , intuitive , intuitive feeling .
And I think that &apos;s the way that the scars of this creature , the way that these scars was , and what I thought was the way that the landscape was , and what I thought was the journey of this , and that was the journey of the journey of this journey .
And after that , I was able to say that when I was a teenager , I was able to get out of the way that I was in the middle of the mess , and I was able to get out of the way , and I was hearing that .
For the first time , I received a high school for the first time , and I got a lot of money , and I got the high school in the solar industry , and I got a high school on my own , and I got a high degree of energy .
I was asked if I could have a friend who was trying to figure out what was going on .
I &apos;m also going to be a <unk> .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re a genius .
And I think that &apos;s the way that we can listen to the two times as a function of time .
I &apos;ve been working on the same kind of <unk> , and I &apos;ve been working in the literature , and I &apos;m going to tell you , what &apos;s wrong with the rest of the world , when I &apos;m working on the <unk> , the question of the question ?
I &apos;ve been learning that I &apos;ve been listening to them all across the corner , and I &apos;ve learned that the reason why I &apos;ve been playing life with them is because it &apos;s the same .
I could have helped me with the most profound part of the world that was equal to the point of view of the visible .
However , the way that we look at the world is that the Sun &apos;s Law is a sense of humor , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and Dr. <unk> , who &apos;s been a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s been a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> , <unk>
And the idea is that when we get to the present , the audience , the person who has a voice and the understanding that it &apos;s all about the same , and it &apos;s a complete and important thing to do .
It &apos;s possible that the way that we can see this is in the way that we &apos;re going to be in the beginning .
And there &apos;s a kind of grammar that &apos;s not going to change the way that we think about the world .
It &apos;s not going to be able to be a guy .
And it &apos;s not going to be the case of people who don &apos;t have to be afraid of .
And I think that &apos;s the way that we can change the world &apos;s laws and protect the world , and to change the world , and to change the world .
In the last 20 years , the artistic variation has been in the middle of five countries , and it &apos;s a study of people who have a role in education , and it &apos;s a great deal of work , and it &apos;s a great deal of responsibility , and it &apos;s going to be a human being , and it &apos;s going to be the human potential .
It &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the human being , the <unk> of the human right to do it .
And when I look at this perspective , the greatest possible idea for our community is to provide health care for somebody to participate in the right to get to the health of the person who is in the right to get to the right age .
We have to be able to live in the way that we have , in terms of the creation of leadership and wisdom .
We &apos;re not doing it . We &apos;re not going to get it .
And the thing is , we can &apos;t do it with what we do , or whether it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not just about the progress of the Sun .
And I said to her , &quot; &quot; When you have a <unk> , you know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about the situation of the people .
So the question is , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
( Applause )
I &apos;m not here to talk about the puzzle .
But what does this picture have ?
Well , it &apos;s not a matter of how you can get a camera to your camera .
And the thing is , my first time , when I bought my first visit , started with my laptop .
I was in the lab with my own , and I was a little bit of a research , because I was using a lot of the tools that we could use to get out of camera .
And the way that you get a picture of a picture is that you have a picture of the movie .
And so , the photo was that the photo was not only true in the right time .
I thought it would be impossible to do .
And I wanted to do something different , and then something started to happen after the photo .
Now , here &apos;s the picture : that &apos;s the way in which the workplace is .
But it &apos;s a <unk> .
And the way that we look at it is to look at reality .
Or , you know , the images that are — you know , the idea of the dark , but the more important , the more you get to the point of the physical , the more you have to go to the surface .
I think it &apos;s the way that we can see the <unk> .
Because , of course , these are not images of us , but we don &apos;t have to be able to see what &apos;s possible by pictures .
I mean , I have to ask for the rest of you to get out of the way .
So this is really the basis for getting a very significant idea to keep holding the memories .
How about the fact that it &apos;s the same kind of thing that seems to be ?
What if there was no such thing as a matter of color in this detail ?
Is it matter that it &apos;s going to be ?
What &apos;s the <unk> of the Illinois ?
It &apos;s a <unk> of the distance .
But the probe is the one that &apos;s going to work on the way that the world is going to work , and it &apos;s just the way that it &apos;s going to make it a little bit .
And this is what the reality of the reality is , what we see is the fact that the reality of reality is really not the way that we see it .
So the idea is simple .
I see this in a context of truth that I &apos;ve created a <unk> reality , which is a real thing .
I &apos;m just showing you a simple simplicity .
There &apos;s a physical need to be able to have three things that have been happening in the universe , and we have a three-dimensional opportunity .
But it looks like a three-dimensional form of what &apos;s happening in the universe .
And I think that &apos;s not going to be there .
So we play with our brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t really matter .
And I see the images that are the same as a picture of the camera .
It &apos;s really the way that they &apos;re going to be able to make a difference .
So , I think the things that we &apos;ve never thought about , the things that I think we think about , are things that we think about , things that we think are going to be in our lives .
And when you see the pictures of the shooting , it &apos;s really really encouraging , because it &apos;s in the process of being a bit of a stack .
So what I want to say is that we have three simple things that we have to be able to do in order to get a really good insight .
As you can see , there &apos;s no significant one of these images .
But in a sense , it &apos;s a thing .
So the first thing that &apos;s happened is that the electrons are the same as the ones that are in the shape of the body .
The second is that the images of the picture have to be the same .
And these two abnormalities , these two <unk> — the same is the same speed .
And the third thing is that , in a sense , the person is going to be able to make a difference , the shape of one person has a stroke , and they &apos;re going to be able to change the way that they start .
It &apos;s a place where it &apos;s not going to be placed in the way that it &apos;s done .
We can &apos;t see the difference between the graphics and the <unk> images of the modern images , the state of the galaxy , the colors of the eye and the right , and the way we look at the space of the screen , the more we look at the space between different images and the other , the more we see it , the
And this is another one .
( Laughter ) People think that this is a bit of a joy , and it &apos;s got to be the bottom of my life .
But it &apos;s all right , and it &apos;s going to be a place that &apos;s going to be a place of different places .
I think that &apos;s more than a place that &apos;s a place of mine , and you don &apos;t need to change your ideas .
But it &apos;s a very hard time .
And I would like to get a few months on this idea of creating a piece of the puzzle and the space that I have for the entire collection of buildings and sciences that I have .
For example , the fish of the fish are the fish .
The candidates are different .
It &apos;s a picture of six of the water .
And I was just painting for the fact that there was a lot of time in the morning , the home of the home system .
So , I think that &apos;s really what we &apos;re going to do with the real .
And it &apos;s a time when it comes to a moment .
Then they have a different picture of the time .
And so , this is a very , very good idea .
And you have a good picture of the picture , and it &apos;s beautiful , and it can be pretty sad .
So we need all the things that we need , and the only thing that drives us to us is the power of our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Julian , you &apos;ve got to be a great fan .
So it was a data set , and it was a data that was more likely to report than the entire world of World justice , the data that was published .
Is this possible ?
Julian Julian : And , of course , is it possible ?
The rest of the world is not that the world is a big deal , but it &apos;s not a matter of how much a world of the world &apos;s life needs .
CA : So how do you do that ?
How do people spread out ?
How do we prevent the principle of the language ?
JA : So , as we know , these are the things that we &apos;ve been able to do , and that &apos;s the way we &apos;ve got the various ways of getting information into the data .
And the reason for that is that we can take the data from the public to the right to get the information into the Internet , and we have a country like Sweden and writing in the public to get the rest of the law .
It &apos;s called the <unk> , and it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a little bit of a challenge , and it &apos;s got a little bit of a bit of a play , so it &apos;s going to be a little bit more difficult — and we &apos;ve been able to protect our emotional response , and we &apos;ve
CA : So you know , the way that you think about it is that you don &apos;t know who you are , but you know what it is .
JA : Right . We know them . We know them , but if you can find the pattern of data , you can actually see that it &apos;s a stroke .
( <unk> ) It &apos;s a <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the CIA , the code of the TED Prize . ( Laughter )
I think we &apos;ll be looking at the price .
This is a data that &apos;s just a few years ago .
So let &apos;s look at the question .
It was a story of Kenya .
How do you speak about how you &apos;re going to talk about your life ?
JA : That &apos;s the <unk> <unk> Report .
In the 2004 , the 2004 of Kenya was discovered after the election .
In 2004 , it was the only time in the prison , and it was the foundation of the 18 years , and it was the only way to get a better education .
That was the right thing to do .
In the case of the <unk> of the <unk> , they announced that they had a chance to take a break from the law with the power of a <unk> .
And the artist &apos;s in Kenya , and now the most popular man , have been using it as a political force .
It &apos;s like the <unk> version of the world &apos;s ideas .
In 2007 , when the year of the year was a few before the 28 years , I had to have a few cases .
This was the case of the new director of New York City , where we started with the money after the street , and then we went to the next three days , and then the following day after that , we got the accounting assignment .
CA : There was a long way to go to the present , not to put it in the way that we would have done , because it was the way that the government was going to change .
JA : Yeah . And the idea was that when the X satellite was sitting at the beginning , then there was a lot of countries in the country , and then there was a village in the country , and it was in the middle of the galaxy .
She had a X .
In a few days , the Kenya began to be started to be comfortable with the press .
The two days of the Kenyan missions were called the <unk> of the Kenya , and the government of Kenya was changing the track of the extra mile , which was able to change the way that they did with it .
CA : So what does it mean for you to have the data that you &apos;re not in ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : So , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got to do with the weather in the air .
The video is a little bit of a little bit of a play . This is a short clip .
And we &apos;ve got a few things in this video that are in the video .
RD : ... the top one , it &apos;s not just the side of it .
Now , they look at the sky .
It &apos;s the Moon . It &apos;s the atmosphere .
You see the story of the pregnancy . She &apos;s smiling .
It &apos;s hitting the fear .
The base is , the horse !
( <unk> ) ( Applause ) So , it &apos;s about the size of the gun . ( <unk> ) I &apos;m serious about the weapon .
In fact , this is a wild <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who is a <unk> , and I &apos;m not talking about this .
And it was to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , it &apos;s going to be a good thing .
We were killing eight of them .
We have two degrees of hydrogen , we &apos;re going to go .
He was . He died .
Five minutes , <unk> , <unk> .
That . <unk> . What was that ?
<unk> , it &apos;s in the middle . It &apos;s been solved , it &apos;s a <unk> .
CA : So how did this video of the video have been done ?
JA : That &apos;s the people who have been there for the work .
It was two to three to four degrees of code in the vehicle .
This is one of the three patients in the video .
CA : So if I didn &apos;t have any excuse to be , what about the 11 of the 11 ?
JA : Yeah . Two Reagan worker , two <unk> of a number .
And in my 20s , he died of the man .
CA : So this is the kind of forced to get into the media .
And what was the key learning that was happening in this ?
JA : I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to talk about the power of people .
And so , when you get to the surface of the human mind , you know , people are pretty much excited about the kind of <unk> — and they &apos;re not supposed to — and they &apos;ve been able to do it .
There are two jet members who have not been a comfortable and <unk> job .
CA : The Swedish President of the Swedish <unk> has been named <unk> <unk> , which was said to you , &quot; &quot; You know , the question is , how do you get the <unk> of the <unk> to print it in the next video ?
Is this true ?
JA : We &apos;ve got to have these articles .
And after about five days of being killed , it was the place where it was 50 , and it was 50 years after we had the exception .
This year , this year , the <unk> of the United States , the head of the United States , and it &apos;s not the only way they &apos;re going to do it .
I was looking at the journey .
CA : If you were to have a <unk> of the European Union , what did you do ?
JA : Well , let &apos;s go out and start . ( CA : Well , the question is : Yeah . ) ( Applause )
They have this kind of material that they have these kinds of materials .
CA : So we &apos;re just talking about this one in a little bit .
What if you &apos;re in the ideological ?
How do you calculate the real story of the mystery ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a question for the world , which is the reason why we can &apos;t be able to get the world out of the way .
The things are very , very important .
And the reason that we have the opportunity to put the benefits of the world is to be the same as the Internet of the economic power that is the ones that have to be done in the public interest , and the better , the better the data that matters in the data , the better it is .
And it &apos;s all around the world , and it &apos;s just the beginning of the public that &apos;s going to depend on this .
CA : But it &apos;s not just that when you think about it , it &apos;s not just the people who have been able to get it , but it &apos;s also got a good solution for all the community .
JA : H , it &apos;s not going to be in the data .
So we have a political agenda .
There &apos;s a few of them , and we have a platform for the creation of the person who &apos;s been in favor of the same content .
There &apos;s a lot of power — I mean , I have a lot of focus on the public , but we have the same kind of thing that we do with the laws of people , and we do it all the time .
CA : So , you know , the good thing about the world is that .
If you were to go to the top of the child in the U.S. , you would say , &quot; &quot; You know , if you want to have a child who &apos;s going to be in the U.S. , you know , &quot; &quot; you know , if you want to raise your own life , you can say , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
The American military looks at the smile of the human being .
And this is the human being in the world , and it &apos;s not that you can see that it &apos;s not human .
I don &apos;t think son is going to be . &quot; &quot; So , what did you answer ? &quot; &quot; And what did you answer ?
JA : So , they &apos;re very good at this .
But you know , the way that you look at the data , the way that you see it is that you don &apos;t need them , but they &apos;re all familiar with this video .
It &apos;s not a change . It &apos;s not a change , it &apos;s not a change , it &apos;s not a change .
They &apos;re seeing every day .
That &apos;s the way we think of the people in the world , and that &apos;s the way we think about the culture of people .
CA : So you can see the way that the government and the government is going to be able to do the secret of the government .
It &apos;s good .
But what &apos;s really remarkable is that you have to put out the core of the continent to make sure that it &apos;s going to light .
JA : Right . So , the answer is , it &apos;s not going to be OK .
Or we don &apos;t have data that &apos;s going to have a lot of interest .
If it &apos;s too late , and it &apos;s going to be really , really hard for us to do things that are going to work , and people who are doing business work are working on their own work .
CA : I think that &apos;s the reason why I think the usual kind of thing — what are the most important — we &apos;re thinking about this in the beginning of the world ?
There &apos;s two ideas that are going to be Julian and Julian .
One is that you can &apos;t see the light of the light .
The second thing is , the job of the job is to be able to do .
Who does it , and what is it ?
How about the threat of the study ?
JA : Well , there are some people who don &apos;t have a job .
CA : That was my <unk> . It was Julian .
We have to work at a low price .
I think this is the time when I say to you , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s going to be a beginning .
What &apos;s the kind of difference that &apos;s been here in these ?
How do you get that ?
JA : So , this is a thing that we see every day .
The last time the diagnosis of the past — the <unk> in the <unk> — it &apos;s been the same as the <unk> in the Gulf of <unk> , which is not as powerful as the blind .
So we went to a survey that was actually a good thing to do with the party that the party was the way that we actually put together the content of the people .
And there was a lot of variation in the same way that the government was going to work .
And the idea was that there was no such a contact with them .
We didn &apos;t know what it was like to write it , and we didn &apos;t know what it was .
We would have a little bit of a <unk> , and we could have a game game of the dance .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to be thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit like a little bit of a kid , so we &apos;re going to be able to make it .
We can &apos;t tell us that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
Well , you know , it &apos;s good . It &apos;s a gray . &quot; &quot; And a long time ago , we asked the government to go and see if this was a new way of meeting , and we asked , &quot; &quot; We need to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , we &apos;ve got a little bit of data on the &quot; &quot; us .
How do you speak about it ?
How about the stock market ?
What really is you ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , the person in the middle is sent to the point of the story of the owner .
And it was the software .
( Applause ) So , they &apos;re very good at the stage .
One of the things that &apos;s been done is that it &apos;s a way of reading a stock cause in a way that &apos;s used by a studio .
CA : So , what &apos;s your own ?
JA : Yeah , so , you know , they &apos;re very , very interested in the way that they &apos;re going to be working .
And the last few months have been able to do our research to protect our mission to create our own employees of the count of the next generation of people .
That &apos;s a little bit of a problem .
We have a lot of our responsibility to be shared with new ways of being in new ways , and we have no reference to the data , and we have not enough trouble to do it .
CA : So what &apos;s the cost of the mission to be done ?
JA : Yes . We &apos;re not going to believe in it .
And in a way , it &apos;s hard to get a lot of progress from a kind of development that is a lot of different ways of being able to get into the data , and the way we think about security is that people have been able to get the job forward .
CA : So , what do you say to this ?
In my case , I found that when I was in my 20s , I was able to change the time of the school .
Is this the data ?
JA : So my parents had a conversation with my grandparents , and I was a religious .
( Laughter ) CA : So , the way we do this is to get a <unk> like a <unk> .
JA : You &apos;ve got the movie &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : So you know , you &apos;ve got a sense of how to do this , and you &apos;ve got the idea that you can see the story of the world .
JA : I was just a <unk> .
I was a <unk> of <unk> .
I was in the audience when I was a kid .
You have to be able to do a little less than a few .
The way that we can do things is to make different kinds of things .
Sadly , the main press of the pigeon is that they &apos;re the only person in the U.S.
The X <unk> is not like a conversation .
CA : I mean , I think you &apos;re not going to put the money on it , and what &apos;s the difference ? What &apos;s the role of those things ?
Could you tell them that you could give them a short data , or a piece of the same , or something ?
JA : So I think I &apos;m a genius .
But the point is that , I think , the people who are in the audience are creating the maps of the world , and they &apos;re helping to be able to help .
I think that &apos;s the way I study people &apos;s lives , and I think , in my life , that &apos;s the way I think .
CA : So , the way to make sure that we have a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
JA : I &apos;m not sure that a few of the people who are in the audience can do the things that I have , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m not going to tell them that the stories of the matter are in the way .
And I &apos;m a long time ago when I was a college .
CA : So what do you think it &apos;s like to talk about periods in the last few years ?
And the problem with which you were using it was that you had the bank , the data , the data , the data that was going on .
And the rest of it was just counting .
You &apos;ve created a good bet . What &apos;s happened ?
JA : That was the big issue .
In the U.K. , the economic growth is the size .
It was one of the greatest <unk> of all .
And the market for the last 10 years was a very , very long time ago in the same way .
We &apos;ve started this data in the lab .
And the five years before the Civil Rights Movement , the first time you had a TV call from the news , the speaker was five years old , and the other one started to know what the temperature was going to be , and we asked the question , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have to go .
We &apos;ve been published with the idea of the concept of the ceiling , and we &apos;ve been talking about the search for the poorest , and we &apos;ve talked about the question .
Every one of the major people in the audience will decide that this is a very important thing to do , and as a result of that , as a few years ago , I was asked to have a new power of the state of Congress , and then the government of the government has a new power to be the most important of the world &apos;s population , the most important asset of
The main people in the world knew that the system was going to be in the way that we were in the system .
And a second ago , this law was held in the dictionary with the central state of Congress .
CA : So , the <unk> .
( Applause ) A lot of water &apos;s going to be a little bit skeptical .
What do you think you think about the future ?
JA : I &apos;m not really sure that there &apos;s a lot of it .
In the world of China and the United States , the whole word is the result of the creation of the creation of all the people and the creation of the creation .
It &apos;s hard to see how it will work .
And we can change the way we live . We can change everything .
CA : I &apos;m sure you want to hear what our religious religions like , Julian , be , like , a lot of the energy .
JA : Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m not a writer .
I &apos;m trying to tell you about my story and writing about writing a little bit about my story , and I want to tell you a little bit about the story of the creation of the author .
But I &apos;ve been telling you that I &apos;ve been speaking about a story of how you can &apos;t get to the point of the past .
I &apos;m going to use the same information that I &apos;m going to use — a few of you — and I think you &apos;ll be able to see a few of the apartment in the middle .
In the past , I &apos;ve been born in the U.K.
And so I &apos;m going to take this from a very short lecture and start with my parents &apos; ideas .
I &apos;ve got a little bit of my life on the horizon , and I &apos;ve got the same as my own .
In the 1970s , a few of the people in the city were very small .
And the idea of the family is that the families in our communities have a huge family , and I grew up with my mother &apos;s passion , and I was just like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m just a woman in my life who &apos;s only pregnant women .
I was in the middle of the women &apos;s rights .
In a way that was a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — it was a moment of time .
In the other , the ones that I had always had , the religious , the less , the less <unk> , the less .
And I was like , you know , the way that I was going to use it was to look at the device , the way it was , to get the blood out of the box .
They &apos;ve been told that the people who are in the hands of the audience are sitting in the hands of the brain are still the same .
And it was a lot of fun , and it was a lot of the same time when I was sitting next to it .
And then there was a little bit of a <unk> .
And then , a few weeks later , the patient was born .
I know that this is a very bizarre journey to talk about , and I &apos;ve never seen it , but I &apos;ve never seen it with the presence of the people who have been on the verge of the audience who are in the audience and the people who have been killed .
I asked her how do you get me ? That was the power of the hearing .
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there are answers , but the power of the matter is the power of the people . &quot; &quot; And the reason why I learned that , in my life , there &apos;s a lot of lessons , and you want to take a look at the world , or whether it &apos;s in the food , or the human soul , and you have to do it with the skies of the
It &apos;s going to be in the inside .
We &apos;re all familiar with each other &apos;s media and the culture of today .
We &apos;re all in the room .
Our favorite , the <unk> , is the way we &apos;re born with the world .
But when we don &apos;t know how to live in a world with the world , we can &apos;t make sense of the risk of working with the world .
We can make our own planet . We have to be our generation , and we can see that we &apos;re in trouble with the human condition .
Our colleagues , our colleagues , are our colleagues and our fellow colleagues , who are the ones that are being the only minister of our focus on our own self .
And the women like me , like I &apos;m talking about , are the women who are the ones that are the top of the day , and they &apos;re just going to be able to go to the bottom of the rock , or the way of it .
And the way that we &apos;re going to do this is to come from the faith of the same East , not to be able to look at the human eye .
And it &apos;s really the most important thing we can do with our lives , in the sense of the world &apos;s greatest vulnerability .
And this is all over the place , and liberals and all the things that are happening in the wild , and the <unk> and the poor and the east .
We &apos;re going to get out of the neighborhoods and the things that we &apos;re going to do in the environment , and we &apos;re going to have the same kind of information .
I think that &apos;s the way that the writing of writing is going to be the way that we have a lot of trouble .
And we can &apos;t know the limitations of the rail , but we can &apos;t see the difference in the way we think about the Earth .
And we can see that there are some other worlds that have been around for the rest of us .
I started writing stories of stories .
And one day , my mother gave me a look at the root of the company , and the stories of my own stories would be the best idea .
Now I think that &apos;s the only time I thought about it , and it was a little bit of a GPS .
I was not happy to be able to tell my kids , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not happy , but I &apos;m not happy to tell my self my self .
I was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> kid who was able to make me feel better than I was in the room .
But it was not that I thought that my life was too late to be heard about my life and what was happening to my life .
I started to write about the fact that I was not interested in the things that were happening to my head .
I started this with my inner love Foundation .
And so , for example , the story of my own favorite story is the story of other people &apos;s stories .
And the reason for this is that they &apos;re going to be able to take a look at the sky , and they &apos;re going to be able to get it back .
And so this was a very different thing .
The word is <unk> .
And I was also able to go through this little , <unk> , <unk> school in the middle of the middle , where I was in the middle of the mess , and I was just a species in the middle of the school .
And I was forced to be in the physical world where I was trying to figure out what I call &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; There was a kid who had all the same children , and they had kids in the classroom , and they had a lot of fun to do in the classroom .
In fact , these kids are just like , you know , they &apos;re like a bigger , but they &apos;re like a bigger <unk> than they are .
We were like , you know , we were like , you know , we were like , you know , that &apos;s kind of fun , but you know , it &apos;s kind of fun to say , and it &apos;s just a little bit of fun , or it &apos;s just a little bit of a conversation .
And it was a little bit like the kid , and he was always going to be <unk> .
And the good thing was , I was able to have a school , and the guy in the British industry has been hacked , and he has been raised by the <unk> and the <unk> of his own music .
( Laughter ) I was a very senior person at the time of the day .
I saw the first time in this school , and I saw the way that I was going to be in the middle of the school .
I didn &apos;t look like all the kids I &apos;d been in , and they asked me to talk about the &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was asked to tell them about my own story , and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got a little bit of my head .
I learned that three united matches in the audience , and this is what it was like : the politics of politics , the head of the war .
We had the first to go from the Sun to the <unk> , the next year .
I had a little bit of a travel to my own life and my imagination , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got all these dreams .
And I was the only ones who were in the closet , and the self was the perfect feeling of being able to feel the same sense of self .
I was like , I &apos;m a very senior , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I was living in a very beautiful and alive environment , and I wrote a lot of my novel .
I was there in the early &apos; 90s .
I was a believer in three or four times as a whole , and I was thinking about the fact that I was a genius .
He was a <unk> , an old , old guy , and he &apos;d never seen his life with his life , and he &apos;d never met the living .
The long run of the long , long , long time ago , when we went to the <unk> , he was sitting on the head of the eye .
And I saw that the car was going to be the same as the <unk> of the leg , the next generation of things that were going to be out of the bed nets — the main thing that I had in my life was that I was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be talking about the same and the valleys of the world , and the way we do it is to take a few hours , and we have a little bit of a mess .
I think that &apos;s the same as the stories of the individual stories .
I &apos;m not going to describe the way that it &apos;s been in a sense of a <unk> , but I &apos;m going to tell you that we &apos;re going to be able to recognize a good role in our daily lives , and we &apos;re just not going to go through the distance of the day , but we &apos;re familiar with the people we &apos;re not familiar with .
I went to the Boston <unk> , and then I went to the Boston <unk> , and I went to the <unk> of the <unk> .
It was not just about the creation of the individual , but it was totally changed .
I started writing at the time .
I &apos;m the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the one that I &apos;m trying to change my career , and it helps me to change my language .
I like to write a book and a lot of my own , and I love the writing , and I love it , and I think it &apos;s more and more and more .
I think I &apos;m thinking about each other , and I think that &apos;s the way I think about each language .
I &apos;ve been working with the same million people in the world who are in the world , and I &apos;ve been thinking about the English language , which is the language of English .
And when the transformation finds the language , then you get the same kind of action .
And so , when we come back , we want to talk to the better word , and we &apos;re going to talk less about the better , better for better , and we talk about how we can do better , because we have the brain and the language .
And this is the difference between the blind .
But I think that &apos;s the way I think about it , and it &apos;s going to be us .
I was a kid who was sitting in Boston — and it was a tremendous amount of me .
I was in a time when I was in my 20s day — day after day , I was sitting next to my parents , and I could go to a place where I could be a part of the day after day after day after day after day .
I was the one who was working with my wife &apos;s love .
( Laughter ) But I went to the site to get a place of mine .
And I started to realize that there was a way of <unk> in my life that I had in the way of the European Union , and I couldn &apos;t even afford to be able to hold the difference in the other way .
I think I &apos;m a little bit of a part of my part of my body , and I &apos;m looking at the truth .
It &apos;s all about my experience and my own experience , and I have the stories of my story .
And I think it &apos;s the same as the story of the story , and the more we have to make it more literally than the human being .
I would like to focus on a moment of magnitude in this issue .
One of the things that I think I have in my mind when I see the light in the United States is that one of the things that &apos;s been around in America .
&quot; I have a feeling of book . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; You &apos;ve got a little less . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked her what I mean .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;ve got a lot of money , you know , there &apos;s a lot of Americans , there &apos;s plenty of U.S. , there &apos;s plenty of money , there &apos;s plenty of American , there &apos;s plenty of money , there &apos;s plenty of money , there &apos;s a lot of different things that are going to be given to you , but what you have is that
But I know that I &apos;m going to go to the rest of it .
He wanted me to be my favorite friend of art .
He wanted to be the same as the prison for the book I was in the book .
I think we &apos;ll talk about the world &apos;s greatest stories , and that &apos;s because we can see the world through political relations , and we can see that the implications of politics are the same as the violence of the political movement .
They are very much the ones that are not the ones who are eager to be in the same position .
If you &apos;re women who are the women who are the Islamic world , you &apos;re looking at the story of Islam , not having sex women .
It &apos;s more , more targeted , and it &apos;s a lot of fear , you know , the picture of the past , the way it &apos;s going to be .
And the world is the same as the world that I &apos;m standing in , which is the way that the world is .
The artistic folks who are the ones that have the ideas to be the same as the people who are the ones who are passionate about the environment are the things that are happening in the history of the countries and the countries who are in favor of the same .
They &apos;re not supposed to be a big deal with our own , but they &apos;re looking at the things that we &apos;re not supposed to do .
In the year 2000 , when the writer was going to be a writer , he asked him about the <unk> of his time and the journey of poetry .
And the guy who &apos;s going to try to make the decision that he &apos;s going to be able to do , he &apos;s got to the roof of the gun , and he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see any of the people who are in the audience , and I &apos;m not going to be able to have anything else , and I &apos;m not going to have anything else . &quot; &quot; And I said ,
It &apos;s a very important condition that &apos;s not going to be a terrible killer of all the printers that are being killed .
And the first time I got a few years ago was that I was very good at the first of a very difficult thing to do .
We &apos;ve been three write up to the extent to a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
( Laughter ) And so we had a lot of our lives and our bodies , and we have a sense of belonging to it .
It was our <unk> .
And so what I &apos;ve been doing is the story of writing stories that are going to be the right type of writing .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
And so they &apos;re not just the ones that are in this way , but they &apos;re also the bigger mass of the people .
And I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s the story of the way that we &apos;re in .
It &apos;s all around the world .
I saw this firsthand in 2005 , and I saw the words of the words of Africa in 2005 .
I was thinking , I &apos;m going to use my own work to be done , and I &apos;ve been writing about the same as the eyes of women .
The small chunk of the world was surrounded by a big chunk of the world .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about my own life , some of them , and I &apos;m going to tell you some of the things that are going to be in the audience .
But I would like to tell you that there are two things that are happening in this room .
It &apos;s a story of a lot .
I &apos;m going to take the point that I &apos;m going to reduce the point of &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to cut it .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you how it &apos;s going to be done , and it &apos;s going to be like the way that it works .
The text is not the same as the political divide , but the political book is not the language of today , but the language of politics is not the language of language .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; The problem with the <unk> and the responsibility of the conflict is that they are all the insights in the public .
And the two are the things that are the two . &quot; &quot; The political thing is that we have a little bit of our conversation .
One is the ability to do that .
They have the same thing .
One is the limit .
The wish is to identify the space .
The political landscape is the only way in which we can get it .
And the water is the water .
And he had a word of &quot; &quot; The <unk> of Things . &quot; &quot; They told me that they had a lot of fun , and they told them that they had a conversation with the rest of the world .
They &apos;ve got the way to change the way that they look , and they &apos;ve been doing it .
And he was supposed to listen to him , he was a genius , and he was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The H was going to cross the borders , the United States , the United States , and the United States was like the <unk> of the <unk> .
The stories of the story are continuing to cross the limits of the future .
And they go to the <unk> and the Israeli politicians , and they have a conversation with a lot of fun , but they also produce a <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> , and they &apos;re just trying to figure out what the way to do it .
And the self should be able to get us to the table .
If it &apos;s not going to do that , it &apos;s not good .
The books are not going to be my wife and she &apos;s a <unk> of her .
But there are also some of the reasons why the book is going to make it .
And after the <unk> and <unk> State Act , the main work was to go out and watch the movie with the same kind of reference to the film that was the first job in the entire part of the world .
And because we think about it , &quot; &quot; The Age of ignorance , &quot; &quot; which is more than ignorance , it &apos;s more important than the fact that we know that the problem is we don &apos;t have to be far more accurate , and we &apos;re not going to be able to have a lot of uncertainty , we know about our own self , we &apos;re not far from the distance , we &apos;re not going to
I love this : It &apos;s a real thing .
And it &apos;s a fixed one .
And it &apos;s all about catastrophe , it &apos;s going to be a constant , it &apos;s going to be in the process .
I &apos;m not sure .
The idea of the story of the story I wrote was called an <unk> , which was a part of the story , and it was a really different way of living in the world .
And my view of this is that I believe that my life is a currency , and it &apos;s all about the fact that it &apos;s going to be a place of mine .
You see the <unk> of the refrigerator , you see the <unk> of the refrigerator , and the way it &apos;s done is to get out of the way .
The space of the Maldives is a place called the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s the place that we have .
That &apos;s the kind of thing that I think it &apos;s like .
We can &apos;t believe in the way that we think about it .
And we can calculate the evidence for the very same and the fundamental things that are happening in the universe that are being taken off the surface of the matter .
And I think that &apos;s the reason why the audience should be brought to the point of view .
I &apos;m going to be a great believer in the summer of the summer .
I love the experience of being 10 to 10 years .
I love my own senses .
I can write about a woman in a minute , and I &apos;ll be a great woman , and she will be a great woman , and she would be a great woman in the world .
We can write all the things that we can do about it .
In the words of <unk> , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m thinking about it , &quot; &quot; and the idea is that I think I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m feeling , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a little bit of a mess . &quot; &quot; And so , it was a little bit of a sense of what it was like .
And I &apos;m not saying that we &apos;re not going to be able to do it , but we &apos;re not going to be able to tell the kids about the things that are happening .
And the way we look at it is that it &apos;s not very good for the ant .
It &apos;s not about what we &apos;re thinking about , what we know , what we know about our conservation and how we can &apos;t relate to .
We have to write about ourselves and our ability to write about our own .
We have to be able to travel from the late <unk> , to the other world .
And the way that I &apos;m going to draw in the corner is to get out of there .
They &apos;re not going to be able to be a <unk> , and they &apos;re all about the state of the whole .
I &apos;m going to end up with a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to finish with the usual kind of stuff , &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so happy , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re very much like a world of humor .
( Applause )
In our sense of poverty , we have a little bit of a sense of responsibility to worry about the hidden masses of our own democracy .
I think this is the little idea .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There are a lot of women who are <unk> .
They &apos;re the women .
I was forced to think about the fact that the goal was to change .
I had a number of years ago , and I was able to do a <unk> .
My mind was essential , and my grandfather was about five seconds of my eye .
I started to understand the importance of the existence .
I was in the process of looking at my life , and I was able to tell you that I had a lot of work , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s the only way you can be more products of the world .
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to be able to start with the women .
We have the very first time in the audience .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very , very clear that you can see that it &apos;s a little bit of a good thing to do .
And when this happened , the person in the room started to talk about four — they were just telling me about the time .
I &apos;m going to tell you the story of my own — you know , &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you how to do it .
What &apos;s going on is what &apos;s going on five times more interesting than the rest of the time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the role of the role is to invest in less than a million .
And here , the idea is , in the <unk> , I want to ask for a few of you who might be sitting at the dinner party , and you say , &quot; &quot; eight , that &apos;s eight , but nothing else , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; eight times a day , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; eight times a day , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re not , &quot; &quot; How are they going to be doing a little bit of a little bit of a drill , and they &apos;ve been so much like they &apos;ve been in the ground , and they &apos;ve been out there , I
I think it &apos;s a very important thing to do .
The good leadership is not the best leader of the 20th century , but it &apos;s not the only way that we can see it before .
Our Titanic is about to be very small .
I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , the way you think about it is that they have been on the verge of the <unk> and the bears .
( Applause ) So , the way that these days , seven hours , 24 hours a day , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , maybe even , in the sense that it &apos;s going to be the same .
And the way we see it is that we &apos;re not going to be able to do something with very much of our life , but the good thing is the good thing for us to be done with our lives , the way we live in our life .
I &apos;m more like that , you know , you can see that the urge to do with the presence of your mobile , the way you can see the big , big mass of your body , is the power of the nest .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And I think that the brain is going to be the brain of the brain , and it &apos;s not going to be the brain .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
I think that &apos;s the way we get to the point .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the normal , and the people who are interested in them are the same .
I &apos;ve learned that there &apos;s a disease in my brain that &apos;s not only available .
I was like , you know , the child who was in the business of life .
If you can see brain regions , the brain is about to be the same as the two .
And it &apos;s a gift that &apos;s a gift of the brain .
And the third hemisphere is , you know , the way we do this is to make a difference .
The two hemisphere is <unk> .
It &apos;s about doing things that are different , and they &apos;re going to be able to take away the things that are happening in the world .
I &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re going to be a <unk> . Thank you very much . ( Laughter )
Our right brain is learning how to do it with the way we think about our actions .
The way that the current self is able to take away the energy that &apos;s going to be what &apos;s going on in the field , the way that the brain is going to look at how the brain is going to look , how it &apos;s like how it &apos;s made of sense , how it &apos;s being done , how it &apos;s like , how it &apos;s like to be positive .
It &apos;s a power to be able to produce the environment of the brain with the body .
And the way we look at this is , we &apos;re very , very attentive .
The future is a half a second , and it &apos;s a whole other place .
It &apos;s the same as the upper hemisphere .
The first half of the time is to take the pressure of the right hemisphere ?
And the left brain is in the language of language .
We &apos;ve got the world &apos;s ability to communicate with our world .
And this is what we call &quot; &quot; the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the idea is that you can &apos;t get it wrong .
I think we can &apos;t afford to eat the food .
And I thought , well , I &apos;m going to do it . I started my job .
And the reason why we could do it was because the people who were in the audience were actually getting out of the way .
I feel like I &apos;m going to be a child in the middle of the day .
And I think that &apos;s the way to do that .
I was the one I &apos;m saying .
I &apos;m not going to do the same with the atomic and molecules of the world .
The only thing I could do was to get the power of the Sun .
I think what I &apos;m thinking of is a little bit of a conversation .
I think there &apos;s a lot of work in the world .
I &apos;m feeling a little bit of fun . And let &apos;s see if this is a real issue .
Just to give you a sense of what you &apos;re like .
It was a very important thing .
And I think that &apos;s the way that I think about the new brain .
And I &apos;m going to be doing it .
And I think that &apos;s the moment in which it &apos;s going to be .
( Laughter ) Then I was a <unk> , which is : &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t have to be a diplomat ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have to be there . &quot;
You need to be willing to have to be a black , I &apos;m not going to be involved in business .
I &apos;m trying to figure out how to do it .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to take a break in the world .
So I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m wearing a phone call , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I call the phone .
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like <unk> .
My parents are in the same way that they &apos;re going to be doing the same thing .
And I think that &apos;s the way that I think we can do it .
How do I get to the point that it &apos;s a big factor ?
And then you can see , I &apos;m going to be able to get to the humble age of the talk .
And we have a chance to do that .
