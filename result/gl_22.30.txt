It was a late of 2005 .
I &apos;ve been working on the the in the , the the Union .
I loved my job , but that exactly I felt a a a a . .
So I walked up to my desk from my fellow Chris <unk> .
Chris carrying over 30 years working at the <unk> , so that the right the right place of the institutions .
I told him Chris that I felt a a stolen .
I was a a bunch of questions about the of science and civil civil pressure : very interesting .
But I wanted to to to communicate to these problems more more in a way that might expect a difference difference .
Chris was straight into the big and and , &quot; all of those questions , which are the five to more ?
&quot; &quot; Yeah , the , , the , , the , , the , , and ...
You see , there &apos;s also great , the IMF &apos;s job as a lie of lies and ...
Of course , the issue of genetic killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ?
&quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s , extended of human genes . &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; You know , you know , the American government <unk> extended of parts of the human body ?
There can be . &quot; &quot; I I I my desk and I I to my Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came him up a a .
&quot; <unk> ! You ! ! ! &quot; who are that to to ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what Chris is a big lawyer , but we didn &apos;t know almost nothing about the of of and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t , but it was not , much less of .
And I was clear that there was a lot that I &apos;d learn before from .
First , first we had to know exactly what you paid when somebody extended .
The genetic extended often included dozens of , , but the most of all are the calls DNA &quot; &quot; DNA &quot; &quot; or whatever , a DNA piece that gets a cell .
The of of this is , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t pay the genes of your body , your your . genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , the problem is that we need to to the genes to to them .
And the extended doesn &apos;t run into a particular gene in particular , but all the the possible versions of that gene .
And what does this mean ?
You may not care about you can spend your genes to a doctor and ask ask you the examine the , to see if you mutations , you without the the of the the of the patent .
It also involves the the of patent the right to that that that that that that gene has been in in or clinical trials .
So we asked these these , , often private companies , , , the parts of the human genome was to help patients .
We have the case of <unk> , a small of 10 years ago with the , , disease , a disease disease that if it &apos;s not if it can cause it , it can cause death .
The company that paid the the two genes associated with this disease created a test to diagnose the syndrome .
But then I walked into the main and I never came to sand .
But the company that the the extended threatening to to to to patent .
two years without being able to do the test .
During that time , Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT .
The genetic patents were a problem that was to .
There are some way to make them versus ?
Well , it turns out that the Supreme Court left of a long list of previous cases , which there are a series of things that are not not <unk> .
It can can can can get products from nature : the air , the water , the the , the elements of the weekends .
He ain &apos;t the laws of nature : the law law , E = .
So , things like very fundamental things and need to be to to all of us , and we &apos;re to be the to .
In our our DNA , the structure of life , the fundamental of of the , that we to the of all our proteins , is so much a product of nature like a law of nature , independently of of that matter in our bodies or in the bottom of a .
To inform us better , we traveled across the country to talk to different experts : scientists , doctors , lawyers , lawyers , priests .
Most of us were that we had to point from a political point , and , and when we at a point of view , a point of view .
All they thought the the possibilities of come out with our on this subject were so like scratch .
But why ?
I &apos;ve that the the the of extended takes to these extended 20 20 20 years .
Now , there was thousands of extended of human genes .
The court of extended was really really at the quo quo , the industry industry , the the of of this practice , and the the to to the genetic extended that &apos;s year after the , , , without followed .
In summary : the courts didn &apos;t have to be willing to to to to to these .
More , not the to me me us in the the challenges , and that in the , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; to be no enough , , &quot; &quot; I , I &apos;m not enough , I &apos;m not enough , I &apos;m not enough
So we started to to to our cause .
The for extended autism is to be : <unk> aggregate the the B , and and it .
A us us not interested in the of of of causes , we think that our would cause a much more .
It &apos;s about scientific scientific , the medical and and the rights of patients .
So we decided to open up a cause that wouldn &apos;t be like the the that there are for , but a cause the the of the civil rights .
And we were to identify a a of genetic extended that that we can defend them their extended to then we organize a coalition of and and experts that tell them that as well as these patents , they have to deliver them into patients and and innovation .
We we we the ideal ideal for for to was <unk> <unk> , a company with the to in Lake Lake City , Utah .
<unk> has the extended of of two genes genes , genes and the <unk> .
Women with certain mutations in these genes have more odds to have cancer and and of .
A a total a total about the evidence of <unk> in the United States .
He was a several various members of of of .
They &apos;ve been many money by their test : over 3,000 dollars .
I share their clinical data with the international community .
And , if you were to the worst of all , for a period of several years , , to to to to to to to that that that that would have been through a team of researchers in France .
I was that during that period , for several years , until a percent of women who made the the to the wrong answer : a negative result that should should be be positive .
This is Kay .
The sister of <unk> , , , developed cancer with 40 and and did the exams with <unk> .
The exam went negative .
The family had played .
The most likely that that that cancer was not present in the family , so that the other family members did not needed to do the test .
More two years later , the <unk> diagnosed a cancer cancer state state state .
So I was that the of of of of that that 12 percent of people who received a negative outcome .
If you were to the right , , , they would have the test , and avoid their cancer .
And I I I I I I I I , I , I I , I , I I , I , I , I , I , I , I , I , I , I , I , that I could embrace these problems .
In a genetic , , of defense , four organizations that set in set up to set up more than 150,000 scientists and professional professional and individual women , and individual and individual , or they were not going to pay the test of <unk> , either they wanted to take a second opinion that they couldn &apos;t afford to , amazingly the .
One of the main challenges that we faced when we we take this case was to think about the way we explain the science .
To argue that what did done was not an invented , and that the genes in the <unk> were products of nature , we had to explain a basic concepts , a kind of basic concept : What is a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
How do you island your DNA , and why does it not an an invented ?
We spend hours and hours with our and , and we &apos;re trying to give the way to explain these concepts concepts in the more .
And at the end end end up putting up the the hand , like the gold .
So that turns out to be DNA is just like to pull gold from a mountain or the library of a river .
You will pay the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t patents your gold .
It has how much work you have to to to to extract the gold of the mountain ; you can &apos;t extended , , keep being gold .
And the gold , once you get it , you can going into all sorts of things in which you couldn &apos;t get going into the when you was on the mountain ; with you , you do , for example . But you can &apos;t can can &apos;t you the gold , because it follows being gold .
In 2009 , we were already ready to introduce the case .
We tried to find the the the the of the New York , and the the , the the , , the the , , the the Robert .
In the of 2010 , the judge the the the the the : 15 pages . One victory victory for us .
When we raise his opinion , we took them to to the and we described to science in case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could could develop a knowledge such as deep the subject in so little time ?
We could not imagine how it had been possible something like this .
So it turned out that the the the that worked the judge the the way that I was , not just was was lawyer — ( Laughter ) was scientific .
And it wasn &apos;t just scientist — I had a Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) You see it &apos;s a lucky .
So <unk> is the the Supreme of the the of the . .
And here the things that the interesting thing .
First , in a moment vital of this case , the government of the United States has gone from .
In the court of the district , the government issued a report to the to the to .
But in the opposite straight in his own office , the government came in a a report in which he said he to this this to the light of the court of the court of the court district of the court , and that DNA DNA was not likely to be paid .
It was very important , and totally unexpected .
The Supreme of the Great Bear of takes all the cases of extended , and it &apos;s called its reputation , very , to the . .
So even with this , we thought , we knew with lose .
And so it was .
It or less .
The decision was at two against 1 .
More than the two instances that we voted against us , we dig up with pure .
The first , the the , the , created its own and new biological theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s a question of the , , and I think that &apos;s the .
<unk> followed that , so that had no sense .
The other other , the the Moore , said that we agreed to be the DNA to be the DNA of nature .
But I want to to say , &quot; &quot; I want to <unk> the biotechnology industry . &quot; &quot; The third , the judge , gave them the .
You &apos;ll notice that a question that you that you to respond to the Supreme .
So , these questions questions the way a a a , a a page , a a with lots of of , , &quot; &quot; where &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s a a , , a a , a a with lots of of , , and , and &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
We did that , which was the most important question that followed .
Five words : Am I paid the human human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think you have to say , &apos; Is it the ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; No .
I want to tell you the the same reaction that I &apos;ve had the day that I &apos;ve spoken about this subject is seven years ago . &quot; &quot; And of course , what would I say ?
The Supreme Court just just around one percent of the cases that we , and we and we .
It &apos;s the day of the era of the , and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people out there , people who were carrying from the 2 : 30 of the the to try to get in court .
Two organizations against cancer cancer , they a demonstration to the the of the court .
Chris and I were hoping together in the hall , moments before he would to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more than than it .
But all of that panic was when I walked into the room room and I saw myself a a lot of known : women that knew that their stories , the geneticists that that it had developed time time of their careers to to to this fight , representatives of a diverse spectrum that they observed at court .
In the room there were three leaders of the Human Project Project , including the <unk> of the , , , who who has a report to the court , in which he would say that he was a a a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities and the the that every single one of the to do a a day to do reality that a day of what we had in the .
The was was .
Chris argued brilliantly .
But for me , the most the most of the most , the the of the Supreme Court trying to understand DNA DNA , through a series of analogy and and and , in a very similar way to how we had done our legal team over the last seven years .
The judgments have been the DNA of DNA with extract a plant plant .
The judge did it with a a of a a of a tree .
And in that that doubt that my favorite , the the , the the the the was the to the &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we leave that day of court , we we felt very confused , but , but , followed by the result .
&quot; &quot; A natural natural segment is a product of nature and it &apos;s not likely to be being paid as just because of the island .
And what &apos;s more , , , , not has nothing . &quot; &quot; <unk> and four hours after the decision , five medical students announced that they start to test the test for the .
Some of them have to exercise the cheaper test of .
Some of it &apos;s a more more than a more exhaustive test that would .
But the decision of the court was going to go to to <unk> .
And it came up with a practice of 25 years that would take to to to human genes humans .
It &apos;s the that that that the innovation and the biomedical research .
And they helped to patients like <unk> , , and and and the to access to the exams that they needed .
<unk> weeks after that the court and his decision , I got a little package in the box of the email .
It was from Bob <unk> , a professor of the University of Duke and one of the first people that I and Chris we were to visit .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re a lot with this case .
Part of what gave us the bravery of deal with those risks was knowing what we were doing the right thing .
The process takes almost eight years since the beginning to ends , with many and and and by the path .
So of course , we were lucky to , but we were the communities we we we , and the the we created , the ones that we us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . ( Laughter ) You know , I &apos;ll just show you a of of eight of my projects , made them in with the family artist .
So we &apos;ve got to call up and and we live in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , I call it &quot; &quot; The phone phone . &quot; &quot; I I I I in the peculiar habit of my uncle to ask me constantly to do things for him , almost as if I was a extension of his body : turn the lights or wear a glass of water or a package of tobacco .
When I grew up , the thing was the worst and I to see it as a way of control .
Of course , I couldn &apos;t say anything ever because the uncle is a very a figure in family family .
But what else I was and was was his use of the phone did .
He would take the and and take it to to me to the number by him .
In response and as a gift , I I &apos;ve this &quot; &quot; The telephone phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they &apos;re doing missing two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way that my uncle uses a child to a person .
The problem is that , when I walked home and went to university , I started to put the of less than their commands .
So I did that I made a machine machine writing with that I could take their and and and the the of the .
But what I had to do was take a role on the car , to the the on the car , write email or and and take out the paper .
So this device would send automatically to the person in the in the the .
You can see that we we we we we can see all of the mechanical devices that understand all the mechanical actions .
So , my uncle just comes along with mechanical interface .
And , since then , since then , the object has to be be and have a touch of , , as I like to to my uncle .
&quot; The next job is a sensible device that we call the &quot; &quot; Principles . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with the notion of being surrounded by a tribe of being teeming , sensitive and brave creatures . &quot;
This works like this . We have these here here on the wall and , behind , we have these little creatures that are going to be . .
And instead of we in silence , they sort of creep out .
And if there &apos;s more silence yet , they will be the .
And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
So , we have these these these in three walls of a room .
And we had a about 500 little little of these little little little little .
And so that &apos;s how it works .
So this is a prototype prototype .
As there is silence , behind behind the assumption , the the of the , of the .
And we we are to the , and we as humans or the creatures .
And they become the to the the sounds of there the little ones .
Don &apos;t react to background sounds .
You &apos;re a train at a moment at a moment .
( Laughter ) But they respond to sounds in first flat . . ( Laughter ) The you in a second .
( Laughter ) We we took very hard for the to make the most possible possible possible .
Each pig has its own behavior , , , changes , changes , etc .
So this is a very premature prototype .
So of course , it got much better after that .
We did that to people , but we saw that people were quite awkward and child with them .
So this is a device of video called &quot; &quot; The person &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued with the idea of play with the invisibility .
How would it be that the invisibility ?
We work with a company company in cameras and and and we asked them to a software with using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow to this young people and to to to a person with the bottom , , invisible , invisible . .
So I &apos;ll show you a very premature prototype .
In the right , you can see at my colleague , which , in fact , is in fact , in is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the video on where the camera makes the invisible .
Sort of the . . <unk> ! It !
You can see how the camera goes and the the .
It &apos;s a premature video , so we haven &apos;t got the and it &apos;s all that , but it &apos;s pretty soon , later later , later later later .
This we got in a room where there was a camera looking at space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people would walk in the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except for a difference : a person was constantly invisible where they want to move in the room room .
This is a video device called & quot; & quot; The missing person & quot; & quot; . We were pretty intrigued by the idea of playing with the notion of invisibility.
So in front of this , this object surrounding us become very strong and robust and and , almost looked very weak .
People walking into the room and almost the ignore the thinking that was was .
But as soon as they passed by , we start to to train the wall of a . .
And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
( Laughter ) This work is a cartoon of a man in the opposite direction .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy importance , which seems to me that falls in his hat and his body grows from him almost almost a plant .
What it &apos;s moving around in his head as if he was standing in a very <unk> motion and and and .
It &apos;s like like like that .
Because if that circle didn &apos;t stand there and the dirt had been very ground , it would start to to the space .
And there are no cables .
I &apos;ll show you an example . When people comes into the room , they find this object .
And , , very slowly , in a few minutes , it &apos;s powerfully , gets speed and it looks like it &apos;s the point of drop .
So this is a important moment because we wanted to be in the the a gut of almost go and help or save the subject .
He doesn &apos;t need it because he himself is able to wake up again .
So this work was a authentic scientific challenge for us and we we work very hard , like most of our jobs , for years years to get a mechanical , a balance and a perfect dynamic .
It was very important to us to establish the exact moment in which it , because if we do it in ways that we lose balance , then we course , and if we don &apos;t enough enough , we don &apos;t have to that that , or that effect , or that that , , to want to help .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quickly video where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
Now this is about nervous , so it &apos;s going to take you .
But it doesn &apos;t need to do , because it gets to up for itself .
So this is a work with which we &apos;ve been very , , working with the of skin skin , with thousands of diverse diverse components , of , , that they like the night sky .
And it &apos;s the scale of the night sky .
We did this around a drop with a form of bear , which was was the homeless .
The idea was to to something cold , and and and abstract , like the the familiar with the familiar with a a of a of of a , that is very good and intimate .
The idea was that at some point in a a of a of a of a bear and almost the the as a hole in space , like you you &apos;re looking at a night sky .
So this is the last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little like this big in front of you in the middle of the room room and that , , , you you you try to try to turn it into a cube twice and it &apos;s about four times its volume .
So this object is in constant expansion and and to create a dynamic with people moving , , like you intend to hide a secret in their or something like that .
We work with a lot of technology , but we actually don &apos;t really like it , because we caused us to understand a lot of suffering in our work for years years and years .
But we &apos;re using because we &apos;re interested in the way we help us express emotions and to patterns of behavior in those creatures that we created .
As a creature in comes to the mind , and almost as if the process of making it to the way that this creature wants to be to , that way that it &apos;s to be to , that way to want to take and feel like if you want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I &apos;m going to start rolling a a a a a a and and it all requires you of of you this : that change change for two minutes .
But before I show you , I want to ask you now , I want to ask you to see your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
So , see , how many of you in many ways ?
It was , , with the legs , the the .
Sometimes we put the arms like that .
We &apos;re them . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s what you see . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s what I see .
So I think that you are now right now .
Let &apos;s go back to this in a minutes and I hope that if you learn to modify a little bit of the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re with with body language and we are in the brain language and we &apos;re in the body language .
You know , in you , , — ( Laughter ) — a a , a a a , a a a a , a a a a , a a a of a or a a of hands .
Narrator : Here are coming out at number 10 .
This police has lucky and and the the president of the United States .
And here comes the first Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ) Amy : One of hands , or his rate , can give us to talk to for weeks and weeks .
even at BBC and New York Times .
So when we think about speech not verbal language or body language , we &apos;re not thinking about language , we talk about language .
As we talk about communication we think about interactions .
What do I communicate to your body language ?
What do I I going to do to you ?
There &apos;s reasons to believe that it &apos;s valid this approach .
The spend a lot of time or or of other people , about judgments .
We have judgments and body language .
These judgments can predict important in life as they go to or or or or or they ask a date .
For example , Nalini Ammody , a University of Tuftsi University , showed that when someone sees 30 seconds of video without physical medical interactions their judgments on whether they approve of the doctor &apos;s appointment , whether that doctor &apos;s going to be demanded or not .
So we didn &apos;t have to see so much with if the doctor was or not with no , but we &apos;d like to to that person and how it &apos;s . .
He was more , Alex <unk> , Princeton , who made the judgments of the political candidate , I I lost a second 70 percent of the result of the result of the career toward the and and the and the and the and , the and the the , the the in the , can drive the to
If you do a bad use of them &apos;s bad idea , right ?
Talk to language not to talk about how to talk about how we like to others , how we are in ourselves and what are the implications .
But we tend to forget the other viewers in which that our language aren &apos;t verbal , that we are ourselves .
<unk> our language doesn &apos;t verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
I am real social psychologist . I &apos;ve studied the prices and lots of in a business business business , so it was inevitable that became interested to the the power of power .
<unk> of all of all of facial , not a potential and and .
What do you are the facial needs not to be able to and ?
Well , well , they are this .
In the animal kingdom have to look at with the expansion ,
You get big , you &apos;re yelling out , you &apos;re essentially opening space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
It &apos;s about opening up .
And it works like this whole animal kingdom , right ?
I &apos;m not going to be just the primates .
Humans do the same . ( Laughs ) So we do so when you have power in a permanent and also when you feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because it Elizabeth the old and universal that are these these of of power .
This speech , I was like , was studied by Jessica , was studied by Jessica <unk> , , and he was a , .
What tells us that as much the people that you you you ever since you born as the people who are having to make the same when they win a physical physical competition .
So that when you crosses the line of goal and you gain no matter if you ever saw anyone do it .
Tell that .
His arms is in , , the cheese .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We do exactly the opposite .
We &apos;re asked . We &apos;ve got to get involved .
So we were small .
So we want to talk to with who &apos;s our .
And both animals just like humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when you together power with .
What we tend to do when it comes to power is the language is not verbal language of the others .
So if someone gets to really powerful with us , we tend to make make us smaller . Don &apos;t .
We take the opposite .
If I see this behavior in class class , what are you ?
In that students from the MBA in the whole language , not verbal power .
There are people who are high , , in the classroom , they &apos;re in the middle of the , , and they &apos;re in the middle of the , , they &apos;re going to take the space .
You sit , you seem to expand .
And they &apos;ll be your hand like this .
Then there are other people who come out .
He &apos;s in his face and his body , sat down in the chair and he &apos;s got it , and they do so when I woke up to hand .
Here &apos;s a two things .
One is not a &apos;t .
You have to see with that sex .
Women are more prone to it to do that than men .
The women become less powerful powerful , , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I &apos;ve ever noticed is that eliminating being connected with the degrees of students and with her level of participation .
And this is very important in the class of MBA because the participation stands for the average of the .
Women have been fighting the business of of the to the sex .
Women women and men are equally ratings and then they these differences in the notes , that similar to be be in part of the . .
And I started asking me : If there are people who come come with that attitude and and , , , they , and they , and they ,
What would be possible to do that other to pretend that that the to to to to and that that the the to participate more ?
My collaborators <unk> Disney , who &apos;s at Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can pretend to do it .
It &apos;s saying , can you do it just by an an and experience an outcome in your behavior that makes makes make make it feel more powerful ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t verbal the way that other people feel and think of us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was : : the language doesn &apos;t verbal what we feel and we think of ourselves ?
There &apos;s evidence that it &apos;s like that .
For example , when we &apos;re happy , but also when we &apos;re getting it , we &apos;re also getting to the the a pen with the teeth like this , , it makes us feel happy .
It works on both ways .
As it comes to power , it also works in two straight .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it also is possible that when we pretend to be powerful , it &apos;s more likely to feel powerful .
Well , the second question was , well , we know , we know that the mind that our our body , but is it true that the body body is changing our mind ?
And when I say mind , in the case of the powerful , I &apos;m talking about you ?
I talk about thoughts and feelings and and physiological components that make those thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I &apos;m talking about hormones .
How is the mind of the compared to the of the that are not the sound ?
The power people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , more and confident , more optimistic .
They &apos;re the sense of that they &apos;re going to win right in games .
Then you tend to think of a more abstract way .
<unk> lots of differences . They take more risks .
There &apos;s a awful lot of the difference between the powerful and the ones that are not the .
<unk> also gives you the differences in two key hormones : the testosterone , which is the hormone of the , and the , , which is the hormone of stress .
The rice maps with a lot of power in the of primates have high levels of testosterone and levels of . And and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and .
What does this mean ? I talk about power , I will come to talk about just testosterone , because I had to do with the .
But the power also has to do with our reaction before the stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with high levels of testosterone , but sensible to stress ?
( Laughter ) You probably haven &apos;t really been ?
We want a person that &apos;s powerful , and and and and not very sensible to stress , a person that &apos;s quiet .
We know that in the of primates , if an an an an an an , if someone has to to take the , , if someone has to embrace that , , they take that page , in the run , , their <unk> <unk> and the the the the
We have that evidence , that body can be to mind , at least at least the facial level , and also that the role of the can be able to mind .
Now , what happens when you give me a change from paper ? What happens if you make a minimum level , like this little bump or intervention ?
We said , &quot; &quot; I want you for for two minutes behaving , so you &apos;ll make you feel more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that was what we did .
We decided to bring people into the lab and do a little experiment , those people , to two minutes , becoming the positions , of power , or weakness . So I &apos;m going to show you show right now five now five of those poses , even though they
This is one .
A couple more more , , the the , of the , , the the .
And this this is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
Here we have a couple couple .
You must stand up , or sitting there .
Here are the positions of weakness .
Now , , they &apos;re small .
This is from very low power .
When you take the <unk> , you really . .
It is what happens .
They come , , in a jar , and I &apos;ll tell you for two minutes : &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to do this or you . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the positions .
So we want to give it a concept of power .
We want to feel the power .
Tell this two minutes .
And we asked them , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you make sure you can &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; And I gave them the opportunity to bet , at the end of the , , we we the other .
That &apos;s all . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
This was what we found .
There &apos;s to to risk , to to ; we find that when they &apos;re in a position of high power to bet to bet the 86 percent .
When they &apos;re in the positions of under power , it &apos;s just 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
Parents of their normal situation to to , the powerful , to a percent of the percent of the percent and the the of percent of 10 percent .
So again , 2 minutes , and we get those changes .
Now the results with the .
The more powerful , a 25 percent of , the more most of our bump has increased to around 15 percent .
Only two minutes by adding these changes changes to to your brain to make it , safe or inevitable , or well , likely to stress stress , and I felt like .
We all know that , , don &apos;t yes ?
It that our language doesn &apos;t notice it to the way to us ourselves ourselves , not just to to each other , but ourselves .
Our body can change the mind .
Next question , of course , is — can a gesture of power in a few minutes change in a few minutes ?
It is in the lab , this experiment , I &apos;m just two minutes .
Where are you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
We think that where it &apos;s in in in in what they have , how in social situations , how they are in the social situations , how they they are , how they they are in the social situations , how they
And where are you being evaluated , and I in the , that they didn &apos;t even know your friends .
For the teenagers &apos;s at the table table .
For some people &apos;s talk in the school .
It can be at present present a business or giving a talk like this or go to an interview of work .
We we set up a with most people people in because of a lot of people , the job of work .
So we published the results , the press press and said — well , well , this is what you you do when you go to a interview , right ?
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve been offered and we say : No , for God , no , it &apos;s not what we wanted to say .
So many reasons , not don &apos;t do that .
Again , it &apos;s not about talk to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
What do you do before you go to a interview ? ? .
So sit down . . . your iPhone your iPhone — or your Android , , &apos;re not going to let anybody out .
You see the the messages , you &apos;re , you , you , when you really should be doing it , maybe you can &apos;t be doing it , maybe in the eye , okay ? ( Laughter ) ( .
That &apos;s what we want to evaluate . Okay ?
We we found the people in the lab , and they were spending high and low and , and , they go through a very stressful job interview .
We have to to the , five minutes of . .
Then you are in the , and the the are are getting to not not verbal to not verbal <unk> so that .
Imagine that this person &apos;s going to interview you .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you .
People hate this .
It &apos;s what Marianne <unk> calls called &quot; &quot; to be in the . . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the .
This is the interview that we let ourselves , , because we wanted to see what happened .
We have have see the rats , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the hypothesis . You know the conditions .
You have no idea that position has taken every person and at the end of all the the , they say , &quot; &quot; we want to contrast these people , &quot; &quot; they all of the of power .
We want to hire them .
We &apos;ve been a a much more more positive in general . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It gets the content content .
It became the presence that I asked to speech .
Because we we we in all those variables variables : do they do , right ?
Do you ask ? ? What are their qualifications ?
These things don &apos;t affect . It &apos;s what affects it .
These kinds of things .
Every person would fall themselves , basically .
They &apos;re what they are .
They put their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So that &apos;s what drives it or the effect .
When I talk about people about this , that our body changes changes our mind and how how can behavior change our way to be , , say , &quot; &quot; It looks like it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; It looks like
I &apos;ll tell you : I do .
I &apos;m not like that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like like a .
So I want to feel like an <unk> .
So I want to get there to feel that I &apos;m not supposed to be there .
It &apos;s very important for me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an an and about feeling like I &apos;m not supposed to be there .
When I was 19 years old I was a terrible accident of car .
I had up and I had a few of .
I was thrown from the car .
I walked into intensive care at the head of I was at the and and I was told my IQ had two two . .
I was my IQ because I became a , and I was a girl .
So I me me from college and I tried to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t be be your career .
So you accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case this this is not . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to deal with that and I have to to say that I need to to give you that I love you to your identity , what you &apos;re , to me was be smart , that I would a that I , that &apos;s the thing that most of you can do .
I felt entirely powerless .
So I worked and worked , and I &apos;ve got lucky , and I worked , and I got lucky , and I worked .
And finally I went back to college .
I &apos;ll just step out my my , , and I &apos;m going to convince you , my my , , , , , , to me , and I &apos;ve I &apos;ve been in Princeton , and I I I I I I I I I , I I I I I I I I don &apos;t .
The night before the show of , , the the of the , was a to the .
It &apos;s like this .
I had so afraid of seeing the next day I I was a and I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to leave . &quot; &quot; She told me , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to leave nothing , because I &apos;ve I &apos;ve and you go .
Okay , so , and this is what you go to do .
You do all the exhibitions that I need .
It &apos;s just to do , and do do and do and do , even though you &apos;re frightened or even paralyzed and having an extra experience , until you get into the moment that say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
I got to here . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done .
Five years of college , a few years ago , I , in in , , I I , I &apos;m at Harvard , I now I &apos;m at Harvard , I I don &apos;t think I &apos;d never think I &apos;d never been there .
The late end of my first year at Harvard , a student I didn &apos;t talked to in the class in all the the , , to give you the , , &quot; &quot; You , you have to participate or you , you &apos;re going to , &quot; &quot; I came to my desk . I &apos;m not sure before .
To be , , told me , &quot; &quot; You should be be here . &quot;
And that was my moment .
Because it happened two things .
The first one , oh my gosh , I I I I I I I don &apos;t feel like like .
Well , I don &apos;t feel like I felt like this , but I &apos;m not going to show you a little bit of a .
The second one was , of course , that I must be here .
Let &apos;s go , she can become it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , of course . Yeah , of course . I must be here ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; You fake it , you &apos;re going to do powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) You &apos;re going to go to class and you &apos;re going to give the best speech of all . &quot; &quot; And you know ? He took the best speech of all , people looked at it and said , &quot; &quot; Oh , no , I don &apos;t even look at it
And that switched on .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no to to it to it .
There &apos;s that end up to to .
There &apos;s to make it happen to to and and to sell it .
The last thing I &apos;m going to say is this .
<unk> changes can bring the big transformations .
Thus , this is two minutes .
I &apos;m to to to the next situation where you you , for two minutes , trying to look at this , in the , in the the , in the the desk , the the with the door .
It &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
<unk> the brain for the better than this situation situation .
It &apos;s the testosterone . .
So I &apos;ve been from that situation that I &apos;t &apos;t tell you I I am .
Same situation of that situation with the sense that I &apos;m going to say who are and and .
I want to ask you before anything that adopt a position of power , and I also want to invite you to to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t solve this . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) The , , people , because the ones that best can use are those without no technology , no no no .
<unk> with them because they can do it in private .
It needed its body , privacy and two minutes to change the change of its life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I I &apos;d like to talk about you about the most large problems of the world .
So I &apos;m going to talk about &quot; &quot; The ecologist &quot; &quot; — probably is that too good option .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to talk about you about what are the great problems of the world ?
And I must say , before I &apos;m going to ask you each of you that you &apos;re and you paper , because you ask me to see what you &apos;re going to see how we do .
So I got there and paper .
The end of , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world of there there had been .
I &apos;ll just going to just some .
800 million people are taking hunger .
Now millions of people don &apos;t have access to water .
Two billion billion sanitation .
<unk> billion people die HIV and AIDS .
The lists go on and on .
Two billion people who are been to by climate change — and .
We &apos;ve got many , many , many problems there .
In the ideal world , we we all all , but we don &apos;t do that .
The truth is that we solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do that , the question that I think we should should do — and that &apos;s what reason why we &apos;re in the session — I mean , if we don &apos;t do everything , we really need to start to ask ourselves , we we we should solve first
That &apos;s the question that I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we have to say , 50 billion of you for spending in the next four years , to get to that world , what should we spend ?
We we we have 10 of the most most challenges of the world , and we just read it . . climate , , , , , , , , , , education , and , and and corrupt and , and and and water , and and and and and and and and and
We think these , , in many ways , we have the biggest problems of the world .
The question was , what do we ask you you are the biggest ?
Why do we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a problem problem with the .
In fact , that was the the of what I talked about in Davos in .
But , , there &apos;s a problem if you care about people who are going to be in the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
And if we think the the of the problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is that the question is not to solve the problems , they &apos;re taking the solutions to problems .
And you know , it was , naturally , if it makes a little bit more complicated .
And to change climate change , it would be something like Kyoto .
For diseases , they could be clinical or networks for mosquitos .
For the , , the the of the , , , and so we could go on .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to have , and I think that in 30 seconds — and I know that somehow it &apos;s something impossible — ( Laughter ) — what you think that you think that are the .
And also — in here , here is , naturally , where the economy comes to go — year , we we don &apos;t we should not do in first place .
What should I be to end of the list ?
Please , it takes only 30 seconds , you speak with the people , and you just imagine that they should be the primary priorities and the fewer fewer of the solutions that we have for the biggest problems in the world .
The amazing thing about this process — of course , I want to say , I I — I I just have 18 minutes to tell you a significant amount of my time , right ?
Me &apos;d like to <unk> , and I make you think about this process , and that &apos;s what we actually did .
And also the collected greatly , and I &apos;m sure I also also going to have these discussions after , to think , how is that we really have to really ?
I said , then , there &apos;s to be to yourself , why would you have a a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the the is incredibly awkward awkward .
Nobody wants to do .
So of course , all the organizations wanting to be in the most high list of a list of that .
But also all the the most of the most of not be in the most high .
And because , you know , there are many more &quot; &quot; no numbers &quot; &quot; than numbers one , it &apos;s logical to not wanting to a list like this .
There &apos;s 60 years that there &apos;s the U.N. , and it bends not if it has done a basic list of the big things that we can do in the world , and we say , well , we should should do first ?
It doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not not making it — every decision decision is a a , so despite all we &apos;re &apos;re to to to it is just just just just just just — and that &apos;s not likely to be as good as you &apos;ve had done to the the ,
So what I &apos;m the I I propose is really to say we had , for a very long period of time , a a situation in which they were in multiple choices .
There &apos;s lots of lots of things that we can do out there , but we don &apos;t have the prices , we don &apos;t have the .
So we had a idea .
So that &apos;s in a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what are prices .
You know that you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a , , could be a dollars .
Could it be a familiar pizza . could it be a , , not ?
We wanted to know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do the the of of of Copenhagen — it &apos;s going to put prices of these issues .
And so , basically , this was the process of the of .
We &apos;ve 30 of the the world , three of of the .
So that we we have three of the the the of the the planet writing about change .
How can we do that ? ? What will its cost ? And what the benefit of it ?
The same with with .
Three of the best experts saying , what can we do ?
What will the price ?
What do we should do about that , and what would the result ?
And so on .
So we took some of the very first economist , eight of the the world , including three two Nobel <unk> , , , in Copenhagen in in in 2004 .
The we call the &quot; &quot; Dream . &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the of Cambridge decided to call the the <unk> <unk> .
That works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And , basically what what they did , was was was a a list .
And then you you you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy to me that I &apos;ve done that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The theme is that , obviously , if you want to know about malaria , ask yourself to an expert on malaria .
If you want to know about climate , ask yourself a a .
But if you want to know that of the two you &apos;re in , you can &apos;t ask the none of the two , because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
That &apos;s what they do the economists .
<unk> .
They take that that something unpleasant of to say , we must do first , and we should do that then .
So that &apos;s the list , and this is the list that I want to share with you .
Of course , you can see see on the web , and I &apos;m sure we we also talk about about the the day .
And they took a list on a list that talked about that there were bad projects — basically , projects where it a a , and and fewer than a of a like result
So they were the the projects , the good and the .
And of course , they &apos;re the the projects that we should should start by doing .
So I &apos;m going to start from the last last in that we &apos;ve to close with the best projects .
These were the bad ones .
As you can see the end of list is now climate change .
It &apos;s to a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things about the people that will say that we should not go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why did we go up ?
And the truth , I also also trying to speak again from this because it &apos;s probably one of the things in which we don &apos;t agree with the ready that you .
The reason that it turned out that we said that that — or do something more than Kyoto — is not a good business because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It is not saying that there is no global warming .
So I mean that &apos;s not a big problem .
But I mean what what we can do by and it &apos;s very little , to a very very cost .
What basically basically shows us , the media of all the other animal models and that Kyoto , if everyone in the world were agree with , about 150 billion of of of the year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two or three times the global global to the development of the the World World .
And to do a very little bit .
All models show that will cause that a about six years towards the .
So a guy in Bangladesh who just had to hit a prediction in at the at the <unk> .
But what &apos;s is is something well , but not very well .
So I get the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something about it .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that half of that that half of that amount , about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the the problems problems of the world .
We could give clean water , sanitation , healthy , and and human beings all the human beings on the planet .
So we should we ask , , we we want to spending twice as well ?
Or do we get something remarkably nice ?
And that &apos;s where where it turns into a wrong project .
It is not to say that we have the money of the world , we don &apos;t want to do .
Soon , when we don &apos;t have , we we just don &apos;t have our first priority .
The projects — I &apos;m not going to discuss all of — but because , , , scale scale , health services — the are for bit , simply because , , , the scale scale of basic services is a great thing .
I would like to do a lot of , but also also and very , but that very really really really . .
One more time , what we tell us and and we suddenly started to think about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , you see a lot of sanitation of sanitation .
One more , the sanitation and the water is incredibly important , but also cost a infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four of the the that should be , when you &apos;re less , the first thing that solve when we talk about how we should solve the problems in the world .
The fourth quarter is malaria — treat malaria .
The the of malaria is about about a couple of million people people every year .
It could even cost a a of the GDP to the for the year for the . .
If we lost a about 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we could cut it to half .
We could avoid dying of a hundred people , but what it &apos;s like to be more important , we could avoid that billion people if they were to each year .
We could also have to to their ability to treat many of the other problems that we have to deal with . . , in the long run , also to to to the global warming .
The third is the free free .
So , the model showed that if we could take the free , and and and and the the of the NSA and Europe , we essentially essentially essentially essentially the global economy to help the the of of of the year , half of the of the year of the year of
Once more , we could actually pick up 200 or 300 billion people from poverty , radically and very quickly , between two and five years ago .
That would be the third best thing I could do .
The second best thing would be to be in the malnutrition .
There &apos;s no in general , they have a very economic path of treating malnutrition , I mean , the lack of .
Basically , half the population of the world has got to of iron , , , and and vitamin
If we invest 12 billion dollars , we could make a a a at a problem .
This would be the second best usual that we could do .
And the best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invested 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what you if you &apos;re to is in to say that we have two very different ways to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is the .
One more , in a ideal world , we we &apos;d get the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should , when we we should invest first .
And the treatment is much much , much more expensive than the .
So we &apos;re , , in that that if you &apos;re in to say , we can do much more more in in the .
They &apos;re for the amount of money that we spend , we can make X right in treatment , and 10 times more in in .
So once we , we we should focus focusing on more than treatment , as the first option .
What this does is that really is to think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like you to you you you you you you you to the of of and , , the ?
How much does it look like to you that we &apos;ve done here ?
Well , <unk> , one of the things is again the change .
I found a lot of people who think that &apos;s very , but that very little , we &apos;ve got to do that .
Then we should not make change change , if there &apos;s no other reason , because it &apos;s a big problem .
But , naturally , we didn &apos;t solve all the the .
We have lots of problems in the world .
And what I want to assure you is that if we focused on us , we will be us in the most rather .
In those that we can do much well more than just a little bit .
And I think , the truth — Thomas <unk> , one of the participant of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; — the really cool thing .
One of the things that people look at , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of the climate change , people will be a lot , much more rich .
We even are the most most most impacts of the .
estimates that a average person in the world in the at the at the the will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , demographics will be two to four times more than than we are .
And of course , we will be even more than that .
But the thing is , that when we talk about saving people , we help people people in Bangladesh in at at <unk> , we &apos;re not talking about a poor .
We are talking about a a fairly rich .
And so the real thing , naturally , , what is say , we want to spending a lot of money helping a little bit , from here to 100 years ago , to a a pretty richer ?
or we want to help people poor , in these , in , , who needs to , who needs to help , and who who who can really help very ?
Or as the said , as you as you can , you — a Chinese Chinese — a a rich , a rich lady , a with a little richer , a a , in the 21 and saying , &quot; &quot; Well , how did you care so much for a little bit with this change of climate change , and if you looked as much as I could to my my grandfather and my , , the who could have have so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what really what what we really have to do is we need to put our priorities in order .
We even don &apos;t agree with the typical way to see this problem .
So of course , that &apos;s fundamentally because climate change has about photos .
You know we have &quot; &quot; He &apos;s a horrible day of &quot; &quot; — it looks great — right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want to see a , , , but I don &apos;t think that &apos;s just a to to the the Pitt Pitt in your next movie in in Tanzania or something like that . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Not from for a movie .
So in many ways , I think that the the of of Copenhagen and the discussion about the is a a defense of problems .
And for sure , it &apos;s not simply to make us feel good , but it &apos;s not really good .
I won &apos;t think about doing the things that have the biggest red , but it &apos;s also going to about doing places where we can actually make a bigger good .
The other , , I think , what are important , is that of some of , , or we &apos;re — to propose a false choice .
Now , we should be do that all , in a world , a world in a world world .
I think we should do all the things , but we don &apos;t do that .
In the , the developed world decided that we were spending twice as much of what we did , now , in the 1970s , in the developing world .
How our aid has been to .
It seems that we &apos;re in the way we solve all of the big problems .
So the same way , people , I would say , but what &apos;s the war ?
You know , we spend 100 billion of of . Why don &apos;t we spend that doing the right in the world .
I &apos;m not going to .
If some of you may talk about Bush for that that makes it that , it &apos;s right .
But of course the whole theme is saying , if you had another 100 billion dollars , we would still want to spend on the best possible cost , right ?
So that &apos;s the real problem , it &apos;s to start and think about what are the .
Is that just briefly , , is this really the ?
You know , when you ask the the to the the world , , you &apos;re just going to ask the white white men , and they &apos;re the to be the , and the the of the the .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a really cool way to look at the entire world .
So we invited the 80 <unk> around the world to that that the problem .
The two requirements were were that they were studying in college , and they English English .
Most of them were , first of all , in the developing of .
They had the same material but they could move away from the subject of the subject , as they really made , to their own .
And the amazing thing was that was was was was very similar — with malnutrition and disease in the and and and in the the .
We have done this many other times .
And there are many other people in the and students and and different things .
They all had as a result of the . .
And that &apos;s me from a big hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a path for us to start to think about our priorities . And I say , what is the most important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , it would love us to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do that , we we can start to think of where we start ?
I see the the of Copenhagen as a process .
The we did in 2004 , and we hope to join a lot more people , to get a lot better at 2008 in 2008 , 2012 .
So the right way to the world to the world . But we also start to think about political policy .
To to start thinking , &quot; &quot; We do make things in that we can win little with a high cost cost , not things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but we do make things things that we can do a huge right , the cost , now . &quot; &quot; So , the end of the day , you might be in with the discussion of how we can really really prioritize , but we have to be honest and honest to say , if there &apos;s some other things that we do , we we we we do .
If we &apos;ve asked a lot about some things , we we we have to ourselves not to worry about each other .
So I hope you &apos;re going to be able to help us fix the better the priorities , and think about how we work better for the world .
Thank you .
There &apos;s a few years , I &apos;ve got out of the house without keys .
I just had to go home house , I visit a friend of the city because the city because that temperature would hold two scales . .
And I was in the , , looking for the pockets and I realized that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , I could take the on the top of the table , the dining table , where they left .
But they were all religious .
So I could spend at night at home of my friend because the early morning had a flight to Europe and I needed to take the passport and the the . .
So I , , and I die of a cold shirt and a little of a and and on the .
He was a a lot of money but neither one of the most in the middle of the night .
Well , we &apos;ve to neuroscience to the the of the .
It means that that , that that the the heart of the , , the the of the , .
So , the next morning when I took me up after sleep , I was worried about the , , and the the that I was going to have in Europe had the mind mind .
And until I get the the train , I I didn &apos;t realize that that the .
So we got back quickly home , with snow snow and ice , in 40 minutes up the passport , and we got to time , but I was going to take my seat the other person &apos;s other person &apos;s
Or , in case you &apos;re usually things bad ,
And he was me , and he was a , and he was me , and he was me , and he was me .
It was something that had taken from the organizational Gary <unk> that I wrote about this , and that was a few years ago and also called it . .
I conclude a team of experts that is trying to determine what happened , right ?
Yeah in the death , as I explained Danny , and then try to determine , you can do , and you can do that .
So I want to talk about you today today &apos;s what we can do about today .
Some things are obvious , each other not the sound so much .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
Design places all over the house for the things that you &apos;re easily easily .
Well , this seems to common sense , and it &apos;s so so much .
There &apos;s a structure structure , a hippocampus that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of things . Where it &apos;s the the , where you can catch the , where you live the the and and .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain , the brain , the the of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain , and it &apos;s the the of the brain .
In fact , there were some of that that the the of the of the of the smell of the of the .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t move too much and not with things that you will move .
So that &apos;s that design for the keys .
To break , , a specific specific . . The scan of read , on a specific table .
If you go to a place and if you &apos;re just <unk> things are going to be in your room when you go .
And when we travel to a a photo with mobile cell ?
<unk> an email with the picture to the to the .
These things seem to be obvious .
Recording that when we &apos;re under stress , the brain emits .
The is is toxic and and the mind .
It consists of that under stress , you &apos;re not going to be able to give the best of you and that should should establish some system .
I Laughter ) So when you have to a a medical decision .
All of this are some point in a situation situation .
And about that I want to talk to you about .
If you &apos;re to that you , you you to to do that , you you have to do a little bit of a , or any decision that you have to do .
So suppose you &apos;re going to doctor and this says , &quot; I &apos;m the results of the evidence and has the cholesterol a little bit . &quot;
You know that cholesterol high school is a to the .
And you you think that the cholesterol high is not very good . And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a drug that &apos;s likely to know that you know , you have a drug that &apos;s likely to know that you are , and you know you &apos;re one of the drugs that you &apos;re you &apos;re have to know .
You would expect a statistics to be a a .
It &apos;s the necessary number to treat . ( Laughter ) And what &apos;s the ?
It &apos;s the number of people that have to have to have a medication before they helps us a person .
And you think of statistics that that ?
The number one is one . My doctor couldn &apos;t have a one that didn &apos;t help me .
But the medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
He didn &apos;t know well the underlying mechanisms .
<unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work between between one 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So what &apos;s Neptin &apos;s revenue in the more recipe that you think is it ?
How many people have to to that before they helps us to help someone ?
This second results is the the .
I even I &apos;ve the data .
And you think about it .
In case , this drug is the to the the of the .
And they include remarkable stuff . ( Laughter ) And Laughter ) And I &apos;m distress in muscles and , , , , , but you &apos;ll think , &quot; &quot; One five percent . Don &apos;t I think I &apos;m me me .
15 times more possibilities than the drug behaving is the to the .
I am not saying if you you take a this or not you &apos;re not going to be a . .
I just should have this conversation with your doctor .
You are right now to have access to this information to be able to talk about the information .
I I &apos;m to this number to to you , and I &apos;m the the , , but actually the the , and the the , and the the , and the the .
And the of the , the the is is 49 .
Yeah : I think that &apos;s that that &apos;s why you get help .
And the side side effects in this case is to up in 50 percent of the patients .
<unk> helpless , , , , , .
Now , the idea of the death to that the conversation progression .
The spot is not getting to build all of this at the moment .
Then you need to think about issues like quality quality of life .
I &apos;m things in which we should think now and talk with the family and loved ones .
Recording : under stress , the brain emits and and one of the things that &apos;s about that is that you get to a lot of systems .
evolution gives it explanation .
And , you know , the the , because if the body is facing these things and they &apos;re not not quickly enough , they &apos;re not even going to quickly .
So , one of the things that you &apos;ve been as you &apos;ve shown up to you and your colleagues .
So we need to train ourselves to think about ways in this kind of of .
I think the most important thing is that we all have have have .
In some point we &apos;re going to play .
The idea is to think about that that can be these these these , establish systems that can minimize us to minimize the injuries or just avoid that these things bad .
So I went to that night with snow at Montreal . When I went back from the journey with the key door of the door inside and a easy easy to remember .
There are absolutely organized crime .
Good day !
Can we have ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing nothing .
&quot; &quot; A letter , for ? ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &#91; in Arabic &#93;
And I was looking at strange , , and I was a to .
&quot; &quot; Come , you see , <unk> of this ! &quot; &quot; he said the shrimp .
It was angry for me to talk to me ,
And just a word made a a a a young man who had a a , a a .
How do you talk about this ?
So , I started to think .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a very much .
How do you get here ?
And this same moment , the the of the , , the same time in the .
Despite all , , , the , of the , , and the , .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos; talk about work . It &apos;s a language that we we we we we we we in the work .
But we have another more reality reality .
And there are studies that have to to to to other languages and and and and studies that have to to other languages and and and that that we have to to to to other other languages .
When I started writing in Arabic , I was to to the in the .
These these , , all their ideas , their their , , their their , , their their , , and with some ideas .
And when I began to write in English English , I was going to be a little bit of a .
When we read their written in English , we we the the , in English , and we the the , in English ,
We can feel that is the same person , and we can feel that the the of the .
In a second place , they say that &apos;s kill their tongue .
This reality really does well developed the developed societies .
The , the , French , the , , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the .
And what was found was that that it was not to us , but they knew that it was that the world , but they were that world , it was not to us , but it was that it that that world , that it was not even not us , but it &apos;s really
Countries that were once like us that they &apos;ve been to their their language , and they have to , and they have to them as a as a .
They told her .
Because if we took any product , we know that it &apos;s not a local product .
No one would believe that we were a local product .
They were going to be consumers , consumer , , and , and , and .
There &apos;s a specific feelings of the , that we can &apos;t have to .
A language are not a one , two or three words or letters in in .
or if a child &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; Dad &quot; &quot; &#91; in English &#93; , you &apos;ve a young man , you &apos;ve got a young people to go by the street saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> &#91; in English &#93; &quot; &quot; ?
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem none , it &apos;s better than look and let &apos;s talk about you about going on .
What I want to tell you is that these these these these things are a specific . .
I have a friend who has French who &apos;s a a French .
One time asked him that I was about it .
And he told me , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent the night whole night . I &apos;m going to translate you to the .
We lost that she &apos;s not who she to her husband , and she &apos;s normal that she doesn &apos;t understand ; her way to think about is different .
She told me , &quot; &quot; He listen to the , with me , and one night , I tried to translate that to that I feel what I feel when I hear the . . &quot; &quot; A I said , &quot; &quot; I ... I &apos;m my my my my and I &apos;m — ( Laughter ) I I I &apos;m my hands and I &apos;m going to . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Okay , what do we do to to protect the Arab language ?
We we &apos;ve to civil society , and we have to be a to the .
While a a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Why do you worry about it ?
It brings this out and and it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; the &quot; .
In the campaign to to Arab building the next slogan : the , , the the .
We say , &quot; &quot; No . Don &apos;t do . . We don &apos;t accept this or I &apos;m not going to . . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to understand that style because of that way .
And when I talk about it , I I me , the Arabic .
So , I — ( Applause ) ( Applause ) We we we want to change our reality , and be convinced that our dreams , aspirations , aspirations and the day .
It &apos;s like us and we think about ourselves as we think .
So we &apos;ve been able to take pictures of young people and dress with characters .
Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; boys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to say , &quot; &quot; Huh , I used to use a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I I I I I the word &quot; &quot; I I &apos;m to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a word &quot; &quot; I I I &apos;ll be a word for you .
I &apos;ll just say , &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and I , &quot; &quot; I , I , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and I , &quot; &quot; I I , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and I , &quot; &quot; I I , &quot; &quot; I , I , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I , I , &quot; &quot; I
And , you know , the you &apos;re the that you &apos;re , in the , , or the you think you have authority , you &apos;re in the language , you &apos;re the to the the , , and you &apos;re the to the the .
A creativity in the language is the path .
So let &apos;s start from now right now .
One alone could make us again global .
I could take the Arab again .
But we have to know , and be convinced that there are a solution , and we need to think of that , and that &apos;s what we need to stop .
In short , what can you do to you from right now ?
Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
Please , I , even though my time , I know , I &apos;ve been , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But they didn &apos;t write in Arabic with characters with these numbers .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a a dead ! It &apos;s a a language !
They were getting in a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to that world and and .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The first babies first at their father was to to the the of the .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell  &quot; &quot; This your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci .
What &apos;s going on in mind since baby ?
If we were to this for 30 years , most people , psychologists , I would say this baby is irrational , alien , <unk> , that I would &apos;t have in the perspective someone else &apos;s or not understand a process of .
In the last 20 years , the science development has completely this theory .
In a certain way , we think the thought of this baby is just like the thought of the most of the .
I &apos;ll just give you an example of this .
One thing that could be to think about this baby , that could be happening by your mind , it &apos;s treating to crack what &apos;s happening in mind in another baby .
In the end and the , one of the most difficult things for us all is to to crack what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the most difficult thing is to understand what others think and feel is not the same thing that we think about and feel .
And even though that &apos;s so much of politics can tell the hard to tell you this to some people .
We wanted to know if the babies and the kids were small to understand this idea so complex about other people .
The question is , how can we ask them ?
The babies don &apos;t speak , and if we asked a couple of three years ago that told us what we think , we just just get a routine of thoughts about about , , and and things like that .
How can we then ask them ?
So , that was the was the .
Betty <unk> , one of my students , and and I , I gave them two four men with food : one with broccoli and other with with with with with the .
The all babies , even at Berkeley , they they they like the and they don &apos;t like the broccoli .
( Laughter ) So , what made made of the was was to test food of the two .
And I did that I was like or not what I was .
The half of the times , I made that they were the and not the broccoli — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , he was a little of broccoli and said , &quot; &quot; Mmm , broccoli .
I I got the broccoli . . &quot; &quot; And then she picked up a <unk> , and she would say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , , .
I got the . . . , , . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; I , I , I , I I I like to take the the opposite of you .
We did this with babies of 15 and 18 months .
Then I got to my hand and I would say , &quot; &quot; I a little little ? &quot;
The question was , how do you give babies to them or or her ?
The amazing thing was that babies were 18 months , , and they to to to talk to the the the the and and the the the the the the .
On the other hand , babies of 15 months who are fighting themselves for her to be that if you like the broccoli , like if you don &apos;t understand it .
And after I looked back at a long-term mouse , I looked at <unk> , what I thought I &apos;d like to all the world .
So there &apos;s two data data in this .
So one thing is that the babies of 18 months already have have have this important of of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understand that they need to act to help other people to get what they . .
And more interesting interesting , , is that babies in 15 months don &apos;t do this ; what suggests that the children of 18 months ago , they first of the to be the in the three months they were the the of of the of the months of the .
So babies know more and more and more than we we we we we to now now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that made in the last 20 years by showing this .
But what if you can ask the question is : Why do kids learn so much ?
And how is it possible that we &apos;re learning so much in so little time ?
It &apos;s saying , the first view , the babies seem pretty much .
And in many many , many , , , are worse than it , because we have to go a long and energy and we keep them living .
If we give to to evolution to search for this mystery of why we lose so much time to taking the , , it turns out that there &apos;s an answer to the , , and it turns out that there are an answer that &apos;s a to the .
If you look at various species species , not only other primates like us , but also other other , , birds , even even <unk> like the dog or the the , , turns out that there &apos;s relationship between childhood childhood , and the the of the brain and the and the the and the the of the species .
One example of this show , this these birds that can see here .
So one of the main , we have the New <unk> .
And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
In certain certain senses are smart as the chimpanzees .
And this is a very studied I &apos;ve been learned to use tools to get to food .
On the other hand , we have to have our our our our .
The chickens , like like the , , , and and , are silly , they &apos;re silly .
I &apos;m very really good at getting big , but I &apos;m not really good at doing anything else .
I mean , babies of the of New <unk> , the , , the , , the the .
And it &apos;s a that their mothers are going to have the maggots in the mouth to the the two of their lives , the time that that pretty much time in the life of a bird .
It &apos;s no , , the chickens are in just a couple of months .
So my childhood is the reason that the the the the the the of the the , the the the the the the the of the .
There &apos;s something in the long that that seems to be closely with with knowledge and learning .
What do we do to have to look at this ?
Some animals like the chickens , they seem to be to do a very good thing .
So the chickens are very good at a particular environment in particular particular environment .
Other creatures , like the color , are not particularly good doing anything , but they &apos;re very good learning to norms of different languages .
And of course , we &apos;re , the the , we &apos;re very far in that brand .
We have brains larger with our bodies , much more than any other animal .
We need more intelligent , more flexible , we can learn more , we can survive in many more Elizabeth : we have have been by the whole planet and even even the space .
And our babies and our children depended on us for far more time than the babies .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) So less than 23 , we we keep them in their own , in their open mouths , and we &apos;re them to the .
Pretty well , why do we look at this ?
One idea is that that strategy , the learning strategy , is a a very powerful and strong way of getting in this world . But it &apos;s got a big one : : it &apos;s a a .
It turns out that until you learn everything , whether it &apos;s .
There would be good thing that would going to be a a and and I &apos;d be thinking , &quot; I know , a a or a ? ? &quot;
It would be better to know that before it was that the .
And the way that evolution evolution was this problem was , it seems to be , with a division of the work .
So we have this periods of time in which we are absolutely protected .
So we have to do nothing . . We learn learn .
And then , in adults , we can take that that we learn from babies and and we put that in practice to go out by the world .
One way of thinking about this is that babies and the children children are like the and the the of the human species .
So people people people who , who we just have to go out , learn and have good good ideas . And we we are the manufacturing and .
We need to take all those ideas that we learned from children and put them in practice .
Another way of this is , instead of thinking about babies and children like adults adults , we think about them as as as in a of a different development of the same species ; like the cast and the . But the the the were the the that we had to by the garden explore , and we would be the the the the of the .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution in the sample that so that that so is , that children are learning , we can learn that they &apos;re a certain learning mechanisms quite powerful .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the computer learning of more powerful on the planet .
While the actual computers are to improve a lot .
It &apos;s certainly a revolution in our way to understand the machines of learning machines .
And the cause of the ideas of this man , by the , , Thomas <unk> , a statistical and mathematician of the 18th century .
Basically , we have a mathematician procedure that used to be used to the probability of the probability to character and the way that scientists find things from the world .
What what scientists do is plan a hypothesis , something with what we could start .
Then they did that question with evidence .
The can make a change the hypothesis ,
I came back to the with new tests , and so on .
What what demands was was a a mathematician mathematician that could do that .
And the math are the basis of the best programs learning that we have today .
There &apos;s 10,000 years , I know that babies should be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s going to happen under these previously , , I think it &apos;s something very similar to the .
And I found out in the the , of the , , in the , in the , , the in the the of the , .
I think babies are doing calculations with very complicated things that are are and so they feel like it works as the world .
Now , this is even more central to the .
If we ask an adult about statistics , you can feel quite stupid .
How is that possible that kids make statistics ?
To try this , we &apos;ve used a machine that has painted in call the <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that you and it alone when it comes to a certain of of some of these images .
And this machine machine so simple , in my lab , and also , , you &apos;ve been to dozens of studies about what are kids learning learning about the world .
I &apos;ll just show you one that we did with <unk> winner , one of my students .
If you show this detector , you &apos;ll probably start to think that the way it &apos;s to is to put a a on the detector .
But the case is that the detector works in a way a a lot of strange .
If you were to go down a a top of the detector , something in which we didn &apos;t think we &apos;d a a , the detector if we were two times .
<unk> that if we put the top of the top , what would be logical , only if it &apos;s two of every six times .
So the question is , likely more likely to have more more obvious .
It seems that the strategy of the is more more effectively than the other .
So we explain this data to take kids out of four and and them to try and try them to try .
And with security , the kids of four years went into the data and they took the object on top of the detector .
There &apos;s two data in this in this .
The first , , I think , are children in four years , and they &apos;re the to the .
What they &apos;re learning to tell you ; they &apos;re learning to tell you .
But subconsciously are already doing calculations that give them a measure of a a measure of . .
The second interesting interesting is that you &apos;re using the evidence to get an idea , a hypothesis about the world , that it looks something something little bit likely to the principle .
In studies that we in in the lab , other similar , , we showed that these kids four years are better better better than just being better at appropriate than the the adults , the same task .
In those circumstances , the kids make statistics to to to to things about the world . But our experiences , after all , and we wanted to see if the kids were gone too .
It &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s been so many interesting studies that shown that these games are like like a kind of a of research program .
We show you one of the laboratory of <unk> Lee .
<unk> has been used to again .
We showed the kids that the the building blocks and the red , not in addition to show a anomaly .
But what you &apos;ll see now is this guy &apos;s going to go five hypotheses at two minutes of time .
Child : And so ?
Child : <unk> that on the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first question is to .
Child : No , ) Child : So this is not , but this one .
Al : You to describe your experimentation .
Child : Why does this insect be coming ?
( Laughter ) Child : Don &apos;t understand .
<unk> : The scientists are used to that face of desperation .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , that &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
( : : : Well , it &apos;s 2 .
Child : So it has to be .
Child : Oh ... it can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( : Now comes comes to the next idea .
I lost the researcher that I got on top of the other .
It was worked .
Child : Oh , that &apos;s because the light just goes up to here , not until here .
And this box there is electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have .
And : Well , that would be the fourth hypothesis .
Child : Now yes , you &apos;re .
If we give it four .
If we have four building in this , it &apos;s it and two to two to two to .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the farm .
So this kid is — this is a very a kid and <unk> , but , but , , I &apos;ve discovered that this is a very typical kid .
If you look at how kids kids , if you ask them to explain something , what they do is they do it .
Pretty typical of the children of four years .
Okay , and what if we feel this kind of creature ?
What if you feel being a one of these bubbles that you can test 5 hypotheses in two minutes ?
If we move through the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many say that babies and children are just conscious , or even they don &apos;t are the are at all .
But I think that &apos;s the opposite .
I think that babies and children are more aware of the adults .
This is what we know about how it &apos;s to adulthood .
A awareness and attention of a adult stopped to focus .
What happens in the adults is that when we decide that something is important or relevant , we we attention .
The awareness of what we &apos;ve got to do is to get up and intense , , that the rest of you almost have .
Then you know how it happens to be in the brain .
When we go into something , the the part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part that the the , , a signal that makes a little part of the brain if you go into more , , better to learn ; and and to the activity in the rest of the brain .
We have so much a very purpose kind of attention .
If you look at babies and children , you see something very very .
I think that babies and our children seem to have a more similar to a a a to a a to focus .
<unk> babies and the children take a much limit attention to a single thing .
But they &apos;re very well getting into account lots of lots of lots of sources of a lot of time .
And if you look at your brains , what you see is that are are the are that are are are to to the and to the the , and that intervention even even don &apos;t takes it .
So that when we say that babies and the kids have problems to provide attention , what really means is that they cost us not to provide attention .
<unk> of the interesting things that I them could say something for just look at that is important .
And this is the kind of attention , the kind of awareness that we should expect to expect .
If we want to think about a way of feeling that kind of awareness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases that we &apos;re in a new situation in which we we we &apos;ve been before ; every time we we we &apos;ve been to to , or when we go to a city for the first time .
In many cases awareness not &apos;t &apos;t , but that if it &apos;s that , it that it it that in in three days in Paris there &apos;s more awareness and and that in all the months back at home , , , , , going to class like a . .
So the way that that coffee , that that that that that that that we take down , actually , the the effect of the the .
So , how do we get a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in , in Paris , for the first time , after you &apos;re going to be three of .
( Laughter ) One wonderful feeling , but I love to love it in the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s okay to be adult .
So I want to say too about the magnificent that are the babies .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
We can do things like like to or to the street alone .
And it has sense that we have a lot of effort in what babies think of as the adults .
But if what we want is to be like those <unk> , have have to mind open , to be open to learning , imagination , creativity , , innovation — maybe , at least sometimes , we we we do that adults just think a little bit like kids .

These are simple simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
These are the things that victims of the genocide in Bosnia in Bosnia .
We are all to these objects and and and and we are the to to these objects and the and and the .
The fact that some of the some victims control as the or the the teeth is a sign that they had no idea what was going on .
They were used to them that they would be be be to .
These objects come from nuns in common of of my field , and we talked about the , , the the the bodies of bodies of the new common common that they find 20 years later of the war .
And they are maybe the biggest discovered that the are the to the .
Over the course of the conflict that we had to to the the the of the 1990s , about 1,000 citizens , civil , , , , killed and other hundred and other hundred hundred and were been found over the operations of combat .
His most were killed , well in the early days of war , or right back into the end of the conflict , they dropped in the hands of the army .
The court court had known by fighting for crimes against humanity and genocide and the .
And is the and and and of a group of ethnic group , and , and , and and and , and the , and the , and the , and the and the , and the and the .
As much as genocide is about killing .
I like the property property , of the cultural , , and basically basically , any sign of its existence of its existence , and it &apos;s basically any signal of its existence , and it &apos;s basically a of of its existence .
genocide is not just killing ; it &apos;s denial of identity , the the of the .
Any , there are some , there &apos;s no perfect crime .
They often reject the that that than their bodies , or or our and weak memory .
These are the of many common fire and the of of of objects is a unique process of of of of the that that in the first act of genocide in Europe from the the University of the in the in the of of the
No body should stand out without discovering or without without without without any or without without without any of .
Once you get into these these these that the the that victims takes to to their <unk> , they they &apos;re they can change and change and they they change .
Thousands of plastic plastic like the ones that you see in in in in in the , , and in the , of the , and the , and the to the .
It &apos;s like , like , in the visual skills of victims but also as valuable valuable valuable in war in the war in the of war .
Sometimes it &apos;s called the extended to get to the physical but visual recognition is a difficult process , and and painful and painful , and and it &apos;s a hard process , and and it &apos;s very painful .
One time , , doctors and lawyers turn out to be the to be to be to be to be to be the of the narrative of the narrative .
There are many lot of , , , even though they don &apos;t believe or just to point out of the view and mind , and the and the and the of the and the .
Now , a few years ago I decided to pictures of a to to create a visual space that the the the the the that the the the that the the the . .
They &apos;re like to make the effects of the , , and they &apos;ll be able to promote the evolution of the . .
( Laughter ) And in this case , somewhere , you can recognize objects or at least than the photos as I remember the enduring , , and and the and of that happened .
The picture is empathy and the familiar of these objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a a , a a , , if you you , and the result is the most similar possible to a document a document , and the the is the the most similar to a a .
When you get to the the the bodies and the and these these these objects , they are the to the and and these objects .
In all of their these these objects are the the for the victims of the victims of the last year that those people who were had to the the of the the .
Thank you very much .

And a few years ago , I decided to follow the the of the great philosopher , , , Morgan , , and , and I , I I I I , I I , I I I , I ,
There &apos;s some few things that I learned learned with these challenges of 30 days ago .
So the months , no , no flying , forget , if we didn &apos;t know that time was much more memorable .
It belongs to my challenge to turning a photograph all the days for a month .
It would have been so hard to have been so much to be .
Then I understood I understood that I was a to .
And the the secret , the secret is not to sleep in the .
But you understand your novel .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m an inner area . &quot;
No . If I want to say , &quot; Am I Nigerian . &quot; &quot;
I learned learned that when I do changes , and I , it &apos;s more likely to keep it forever .
In fact , they &apos;re good .

I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because of course , this is a photograph that can &apos;t pick up with their cameras .
So all of my interest in my photograph started when I I was my first digital camera to 15 years ago .
My passion with my passion before the print , , was a little bit different , because when I went into the camera the process was more well in planning .
And when you take a a photograph with a camera , the process you have when you you when you you the .
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the place at the time at the time .
I was to to do .
So I wanted to create something different , something different where the process process went to to push the . .
It like this : a construction on a very , very . .
But he &apos;s got a unexpected burden .
And despite this , , , a level of journalism .
Or pictures like these dark and and and at a time but all of the common goal of keeping the level of .
When I say a <unk> I I say .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that I can really captured but I always always want to look like that that that I was captured in many ways as a photograph .
Talk on that one will have to think a moment to discover the trick .
So this has more to see with a idea that with catch a idea really .
But what is the trick that makes the real look real ?
You you see that you would like to swim in the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
And what is what what about the illusion ?
The times the point is the illusion .
But by the end of our way , we &apos;re going to interpret the world and how it can be be in a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not about whether it &apos;s a realistic but what &apos;s is .
And I think that the basics are very simple .
I &apos;d like like to a a of the reality that we take different bits of reality and we we we take a a reality .
Let me show you an easy example .
Here we have three objects , perfectly , , something that we can all relate to to live in a three-dimensional world .
But then there &apos;s a way way that can can create something that &apos;s still feel like it .
But , at the same time , we know that can &apos;t exist .
So , we &apos;re to our brain because the brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that that it really doesn &apos;t make sense .
And I see the same process to combine pictures .
You consists of combine in different different .
Now the things that make a photograph look like , I think that are those who are in that we don &apos;t even think about it ; things that us in our us in our daily life .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have into account this . Because the opposite seem weird in a ways .
So I &apos;d like to say that there are three three three three three three three to to get results .
How you can see , these images are not very special .
But combine , you can create something like this .
So the first first thing is that the photos have taken the same thing .
Secondly , the photos have been able to have to same kind of light .
And these two images are up with these requirements ; they were been at the same time and with the same kind of light .
The third point comes from to to to to to start and and the different images with a perfect . .
You must be impossible to say how you you on the picture reality .
And the , the color , the contrast and the and the the that there are between the different images , adding a of of , , , as deep , , colors , colors and noise , we the the the images , and we do that look like a single image , despite fact fact that a single
So this is another example .
( Laughter ) And I think this is the image of a landscape and the lower is what was been manipulated .
But this image is totally totally about pictures of different places .
Personally I think that &apos;s easier to actually create a place that I think it , because one doesn &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that has on your head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , we knew that I had several months to the design , to find the different places for the bits of the <unk> .
For example , the fish was captured on a trip to catch .
Women are of a different . .
A part of was captured in a of of stone .
And yes , I made red red home from the the of the island to that to to the more .
So I used to get a result , I think it makes failure .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
So I just to combine the different pictures .
And here each piece is very very just . .
If a does a good job by taking the photos the the result can be very beautiful and a very real .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that &apos;s in us is our imagination .
Thank you .

In this slide , you have to look for your age in the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we left out the map .
So , we we &apos;re using all the world that we &apos;re using around the world that we &apos;re using around the world in which we &apos;re using across the world world that we &apos;re using in the world world .
And the brand brand is entirely different than it is , it &apos;s completely different .
It changes our role of the critical period .
We had to establish a group of control control .
But we ask that that role of paper , we we have to be able to do that .
And another group that had just exposure to an audio , and another group that had just been exposure to an audio and a half group of people had just been to an audio and a .
What you see here is the result of the audio ,
Ten months ago .
