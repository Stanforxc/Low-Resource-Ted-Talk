I &apos;m not speaking to you today about the fact that I &apos;m speaking .
I &apos;m working on the idea of the Sun .
And my little red dot is to go out to the environment and do it .
And that &apos;s the kind of news that &apos;s been done for this .
This is a little video that we &apos;re not going to do .
So , it &apos;s a rope .
It can be a little bit of a time .
( Laughter ) I — this is what I &apos;m going to be doing — I &apos;m going to tell you this : I &apos;m not going to go through the window . ( Laughter )
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
( Music ) This is not . ( Laughter )
( Laughter )
It &apos;s a map of the sun .
Oh , I &apos;m <unk> .
Yeah . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter )
I want to just give you a sense of what you &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re going to come back from a few minutes later , hoping that if you &apos;re less likely to have control , that &apos;s going to significantly change your life .
We &apos;ve been very interested in talking about language , but rather than the language of the other people &apos;s language .
The new vocabulary makes us think : ( Laughter ) If you don &apos;t have a lot of limitations or a smile , it &apos;s a simple thing to look at , or something like , or something that &apos;s just a little bit of a
<unk> : These are the <unk> 10 numbers .
This is the <unk> of the United States of America , the <unk> .
And when you go over it , it &apos;s called the — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re . We &apos;re releasing our shoes .
We &apos;re all exhausted .
We &apos;re working with the man who &apos;s not visible to the man .
You see , they &apos;re just as excited and people &apos;s things .
And it &apos;s a strong , strong relationship , and it turns out that it &apos;s a magic thing .
We have to go to the <unk> , to try to complete the gestures of others .
So , if you &apos;re a force , we &apos;re trying to pull out the humility , and we &apos;re trying to replace it , and we &apos;re trying to get them to settle .
In the case , we &apos;re holding the force to the ground .
Do you know what the hell is the recipe ?
I see that MBA rarely did not seem to be able to get the extra noise out of their own .
They &apos;re taking their own names , they &apos;re taking their own , and they &apos;re going to go into the room , and they &apos;re going to go through the classroom , and they &apos;re going to be in
They sit in two of the two <unk> , little ones .
They &apos;re just being in this direction .
They don &apos;t seem to see .
They &apos;re the ones that are the ones that are sitting and they &apos;re the <unk> .
So I was a couple of facts for my article .
The first one is to get you to see the point .
It &apos;s possible , it depends on this .
So women are actually <unk> more of this law than the male .
The girls themselves feel more vulnerable to men than men , and that &apos;s not a compliment .
And it &apos;s also been known as a <unk> .
And that &apos;s important for the MBA of MBA , because they affect their own inner role .
The price of the gene gets to fight , and the gene gets into the contract .
It &apos;s the same person who &apos;s taking a career and the women &apos;s course at the end of the course , and they &apos;re looking at different grades , and it &apos;s about engagement .
So I started thinking about myself , and I &apos;ve found that in the middle of this session , there are more active lessons learned in the lessons .
If they look at these videos , will they bring their own more activism in the laws of their own ?
It was not going to be true if we had a lie in the first place .
So , is it that we can make our sense of the speed of our behavior , the more we think about the behavior that changes when we change the behavior of our behavior , the more we think about
We can also , we know , are the words and memes that are the other way around us and make them feel intuitive .
But the question is , is that the question of discovery and architects is that we don &apos;t really have the impact of the memes .
But we are both familiar with our beliefs , and we can &apos;t get to the very same ones .
So , that &apos;s all true .
It &apos;s also the power .
We tend to be very strong , and yet we tend to think that we are very strong , but we also feel that we &apos;re very strong and powerful .
How we think of our thinking as we know it , is that we change our thinking , change our thinking .
How do I think about the power of power , when you think about it ?
And I think that the idea of the physics , the way that we can , and the thing that makes the physics , and I see it , and I see these hormones , I study hormones .
What is the idea of seeing the men &apos;s problems ?
It &apos;s not like the people who are strong , but they &apos;re strong people .
We &apos;re not saying , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t , &quot; &quot; and then we call them .
And I &apos;m a <unk> .
They chose to play a game with a very high risk of using the risk of being a player .
And you can see that the <unk> is a <unk> , but that &apos;s the odds of the change .
And we &apos;re testing the test of the test .
I was looking for 20 percent of the time that I had spent the year with the power of power , and I was looking for 20 percent of the time in the test for the other .
The two lines are going to be the ones that have been trained .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to start with .
I &apos;ve been a <unk> of about 25 percent of the work in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> , and I &apos;ve been given 15 percent of them .
The two lines of gravity can make sense of our brain , more ambitious , more ambitious , more ambitious , and feel comfortable .
This is the feeling we &apos;re all wrong , OK ?
So our language is not to make sense of the matter , and the way we think about ourselves is that we don &apos;t think about how we think about ourselves and not only for the human being .
And our idea of other body thoughts is that it changes .
The next question we &apos;re interested in is whether our life has a few minutes to change our perspectives powerfully .
This is a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
So , can you imagine the <unk> of this thing ?
It &apos;s the way that we think about it .
And the idea is that these poses movements can be used to be used to practice the public safety .
Are we still <unk> the status quo ?
This is the nest table , for example , for innovation .
They &apos;re the schools for the kids .
It &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> , or a business interview .
We have a idea that you can actually take your work out of business , because you can &apos;t see many of you , because you can experience it .
&quot; So we went out and said , &quot; &quot; Well , the media debated them , and the writers told us , &quot; &quot; Do we have to go write interviews like this ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Well , we &apos;ve been able to deny this idea . We &apos;ve never been , no , no , no .
You don &apos;t feel like you &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s not with your title .
You &apos;re a person who is your own .
What are you doing before ?
You sit . You sit up and look at your Android or your Android .
You look at your own , you bend your own , you get the essence of your own , and you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re going to be sitting right here , and you &apos;re sitting in the moon .
That &apos;s what we wanted to do .
<unk> , <unk> , had a strong , powerful job of the strength of the new and strong , and then a lot of them .
He was taken five minutes of interviews with the interview .
We &apos;ve been taught that we should not use encryption to take a <unk> of the effect of the effect of the matter .
And to look at the question , the question of whether it &apos;s <unk> is more than just being held .
Nobody ever likes it .
&quot; Marín Lafrance calls this &quot; &quot; satisfactory . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what &apos;s going to increase the neocortical level . &quot;
We had a interview with a interview with a unique interview .
And then we took four of these items .
From those days , our eyes were <unk> .
And he had no news at all . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , when you go to the audience , they &apos;re going to take care of it . &quot; &quot; And he showed that he had a higher power
&quot; &quot; I want to take a look at the work .
And the ones that we have are more mobile . &quot; &quot; What is the impact ?
That &apos;s not the case .
Their experiences depends on what they &apos;re doing with them .
We looked at the other way of looking at the other ones , and then , in the case of the past , what is it wrong ?
Who have you had a table ?
There was no difference .
And the effects of this are not that large .
People were alone only in the real world .
So they were able to force themselves .
They showed up to their ideas , their models .
And that &apos;s the range of the things that are happening .
And when I say people , I think our self is our thinking , &quot; &quot; Our behavior is our thinking , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to change our behavior , &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Well ,
I want to be the real tech , and I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go into the real world .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I want to ask you to hear a little bit of the truth .
I want you to be a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m very good at these words , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I want to tell you that I don &apos;t have a room . &quot; &quot; I want to tell you a little story about the mystery of the
At the age of 19 , I had a lot of people .
And it &apos;s a lot of the time that we have a lot of it to the moon .
I was surrounded by a few times .
I was stuck with the fact that I was in the <unk> , and I was getting confused , and I was standing in the news , and I was standing in the news of the line , and I was very painful to come up
I was a <unk> , because I was born with a child and a child .
I was trying to get back to the college , and I was trying to get back to the rest of the room .
They &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ll know that you &apos;re going to finish the arm .
The things that you can do , but you don &apos;t have the arm — they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to start with this , but you have to be a part of the fact that you have a special property , and you have to be able to see what you &apos;re all about . &quot; &quot; And I started to realize that you couldn &apos;t do anything that you had to do .
I felt completely <unk> .
I was working , I was working on my work , and I was going to have a job .
I finished the arm .
I had a time when I was a woman , and I was in my country , and I was in the <unk> <unk> , and I was asked to go to college , and I was asked , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a problem . &quot; &quot; I was reminded of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was reminded of the first place .
I was just about to be .
I was told that the two of the people who were in the U.S.
And that night , I was a girl .
I was scared to get my friend in the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m okay . I &apos;m not going to know . &quot; &quot; So I told me , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you know ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to get it .
It &apos;s that you will be able to do it , and you &apos;ll be able to do it .
And it &apos;s in the shoes .
You &apos;re going to be doing all the things you &apos;re not going to do .
If you &apos;re scared , you &apos;re going to be free , and you &apos;re going to be wondering , and you &apos;re going to listen to your body , and you &apos;re going to see it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I would say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> !
It &apos;s got me to be able to go out and work with it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to work out how to do it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to do this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time with this .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d have a child in the <unk> , but I &apos;ve got a couple of years ago , I &apos;m a <unk> , I &apos;m a <unk> , I &apos;m a workaholic , I &apos;m not in the way , I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to be there , but I don &apos;t think I &apos;m a long , long time ago .
And after the first year I was at the end of the first year , I was told , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , no , it &apos;s not just a school , but I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that you &apos;re not going to be able to get it . &quot; &quot; I thought it was good .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in the wrong place . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have my place to be .
So that &apos;s the moment when I got into the circle .
Because two things started .
The first one I would have to say , I would have to make that feeling .
But he was the only feeling he had and he was the feeling .
And I was like , I &apos;ve got to understand that it &apos;s perfectly true .
So , it could be able to make it out of the box .
And I think it &apos;s a real thing : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a full thing !
You can show it to the point where you can go to the point where you can show it out , and you go to the room , and you go to the room and you go to the room , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have to go to the room . &quot; &quot; He did not know that he was there in his mouth , he was there in the room , he was sitting here , he was there , he was there , he was there , he was there , he was a real , real , and he was doing it .
It was changed .
I would like to say that you can &apos;t tell me that you &apos;re going to have a problem .
So , imagine the real challenge .
You &apos;ve got to make it happen by yourself .
You know , I &apos;m not going to know that .
The normal ones can make a major difference .
Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , let me tell you , this is the two .
Two , two , two , two .
So , before you get a conversation , you &apos;re going to try to do it , and try to do it before you &apos;re going to try to do it , and in the middle of the room , you &apos;re on the table , on
Take a break .
The root of your brain is the best that you can get .
It &apos;s your <unk> . You reduce your own .
&quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t give them a show that I would have been told for them to be . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to give them a sense of what it is .
Your vision is &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure I &apos;m told to give them who I am and I know . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be on the ground .
I &apos;m going to take you through your own body , and I want to tell you about them , and I &apos;m also going to tell you about the title of the conversation , because it &apos;s very easy .
It &apos;s not that — ( Laughter ) — this is not the case . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s about giving you your learning and people with a lot of money , and people who are not contributing to the world , how much and
And you know , you can do this with your own hands .
Because the only reason that we have to do is make the body a little bit more likely to change their life .
Thank you .

We &apos;re all in the world .
The most amazing of all of their <unk> units is the invisible .
And the theory of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , is the ones that are facing the potential of the rule .
They &apos;ve created a lot of <unk> of the destruction of the <unk> of the <unk> .
The bigger , the <unk> , the heavy and necessary work , and they &apos;re all very strong .
Here , in the <unk> , the 90 percent of the product are collected .
They work a lot of <unk> , and they have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the cars that are made out of a few smaller things , and they are made out of the metal and the metal , and they &apos;re ready for the entire time .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m not going to meet the characters that I &apos;ve met with the <unk> .
I am an activist and activist and I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m a believer and a partner to talk about the issues of politics and religion .
In 2007 , I was transformed from the <unk> of my work in 2007 .
But I was also a <unk> .
My colleagues and I , too , have more attention to my mind , and they helped us to make the <unk> and the money that they gave themselves .
These are the <unk> and the <unk> in the Palestinian meditation .
So , it &apos;s a thing that I &apos;ve been working on , and I &apos;ve been working on this kind of field of work .
I was very fortunate to have a lot of <unk> , and I was very privileged to go around the world and have a lot of tears .
I was in the corner of the world , not the <unk> of the <unk> .
In the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , I came to find out that there was a room in the United States , and in the country , and the United States .
And I realized that this was a lot more than a human being , because it was a big business .
And then I created a movement that was called &quot; &quot; The Garden of <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was a movement of the &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It was a movement of entrepreneurship that was known for the

So , &quot; &quot; The <unk> of <unk> , &quot; &quot; was a great social movement that was capable of helping and <unk> with the help of the city .
Catadors have been trained by doctors , stomatopos , butterflies , hair stalkers , table gangs , and those who are familiar with professionals and health activists .
And the way that we were <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
They also have the same resources for transparency : they are the same , the short ones and the courage .
And the last one is that they &apos;re actually not painted by the size of the last few .
&quot; &quot; The <unk> of <unk> , &quot; &quot; Paul , the de Jane and the <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> .
But the fact that we &apos;ve made a lot of money to get the students to be brave , that they &apos;re made of <unk> , that they &apos;re <unk> , that they &apos;re made of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
So , the raw thing would be all about .
In two years , in two years , 800 feet of wine and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; movement , was released in the local school , and we were all
And they would be successful , and they would be successful , and they would be successful .
They know that they can be treated with their eyes , and they can also get their own interest in their own form of affairs and community .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you that we can &apos;t find a lot of the same , and we can &apos;t find other landscapes in the way that you might see them .
Try to see if there &apos;s no such thing as a <unk> and <unk> .
And you don &apos;t want to , you know , 20 million people in the world .
And as you see , you know , you know , you can &apos;t see them as a part of our society , and you know , as we saw one of them , you know , the life of our society .
I &apos;m going to thank the stereo <unk> , thank you .

Five years ago , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was a writer in the &apos; 60s , was invited to be the leader of the <unk> , and the <unk> was the leader of the <unk> .
We didn &apos;t know what was meant to be causing Nooraza , but when we started to see those bright breakthroughs , they went to another prison in New York City : tunnels , prisoners and U.N. , and they did their very well-being instruments .
The plans of the <unk> plan was <unk> .
But sadly , in 1993 , the world never thought about the world &apos;s novel .
In the last year , the <unk> was a <unk> .
And the next one is my studio .
In 1983 , in the &apos; 83 , I was just the main one and the <unk> , the <unk> teacher , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> teacher , the teacher &apos;s been turned into the world , and I was
After my age , my family was increasingly changed .
I had a lot of <unk> , a lot of people who would have been very small , very few Muslims .
I learned about this : when people talk about the age of four , then we know that the human hair is not only the equivalent of the human hair , but it will take a long time to get the human experience .
Every single one of them will be able to show people who are facing their faith , who are facing their faith in every single one of the people who have been living in a state of state and helping others to follow their own
I was a few months ago when I went to the University of London , and I was told that they were going to go to the police station , and I was going to go to the police in a couple of months with
I was telling you , I &apos;m going to go to school .
We were shooting back to the <unk> . We didn &apos;t know that the brain was on the hidden side of the brain .
And when my husband gave me my hair , he would help me get to the floor and help me with the next 30 meters .
The last laugh that I had ever heard of the day was the little <unk> lamp that I had ever taken , and the little Dead guy was getting a little bit of this .
My husband said , &quot; &quot; You know , the older girl , the girl , the &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; The king of the old age . &quot; &quot; And the father said , &quot; &quot; The old one is the
And that was the gentleman that was laughing in the same way , but I was also seeing what happened after a couple years of research .
They thought , &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re the one who &apos;s got to be the father of my father and what they &apos;re seeing .
And in recent recent days , these people who have been <unk> about 700 pounds of trash and <unk> , the World Food , the <unk> of the landscape , the death of the World Trade Center , has been known for the <unk> of
I took these people to my community , and I was able to get them to work on the same side .
&quot; &quot; Whoa , &quot; &quot; and I was the people that I called the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the people that I call the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — who I call &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said
I had been able to change our age and our community , and that was that my colleagues had become friends , and this forces of opportunity for my friends .
And I think that we would have a chance to think about the other people who were not going to be in the room .
Every time I got a kiss , I was surrounded by the kid &apos;s kid , and I was totally raised by the child .
I was trying to be hidden on my way to the public , to be clear , to be in the middle of my group , but it was also clear that the new <unk> and the ball was going to be the most <unk>
So I read a lot of my parents &apos; books , and I was playing with the book , watching play .
I was reminded of this because I had the same conflicts , the fact that I was not prepared to be a person in the middle of the night , but I was not prepared to be prepared by the fact that life was a
I grew up in an environment where people are naturally , and I &apos;m just blown into a place where they can be applied .
What have we seen in my eyes ?
I was the first to have the experience of the year 2000 , which was the first time that I had ever encountered this idea of a year in the year 2000 .
I was a <unk> , and I was asked by the software that I was going to have a role in the <unk> of the National School of <unk> .
I was not quite the same as the most popular person I &apos;ve ever been in the middle of the room , but I was also surprised by the fact that the child was very much the same as the most severe , but very
The most common people who have the potential to have the potential of our group .
I was in the last few years watching anyone who was a friend who was a friend of mine who was a friend of friend who lived in the last day .
And this was a few days ago , but I was also a figure that was always being fought to the point of the two selves .
I was never before the beginning of her life , and I was able to make a sense that I had a lot of sense that I had a sense of being rejected .
And the irony of becoming a process , which I did , was that I was working on the way that I was doing this for the other side of the <unk> Garden .
I was just about to be religious and played by people who had been around in the audience , and that was to play a key role in the way that I was going to be .
I was privileged to have a greater sense of appreciation of the destruction of the destruction of humanity , and I was reminded of all the images that all the major religions are being made .
And it seemed to me , I &apos;ve been working on a lot of work , and I &apos;ve been working with the work of the people who are the most ambitious people I &apos;ve ever seen .
I &apos;ve drawn a love , a very angry one , and I &apos;m a very privileged one who has a lot of fun to have a conversation with me , and I &apos;m a very privileged , very talented artist who is not a
I would love to have a real life of what I would call a <unk> , a real life , a real life , a reality .
I don &apos;t know how much you &apos;re supposed to be , but I &apos;m very good at what &apos;s happening to the reason for the reason that it &apos;s not so much of it .
And then I was &quot; &quot; The New History . &quot; &quot; I was taking care of my <unk> Super <unk> , who was not a good sign of the human community , and he helped me realize that the human owner of the <unk> and the <unk> of his own life was not a good connection .
Conor had been hiding in the same way that I hear the word &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; in moments of the words &apos; s .
And when I was a kid , I was not very interested in the world , and I was able to show that the world &apos;s opinion is more likely to be more effective , than my worldview .
I was happy to speak about my day , my worldview , my personal world , and I was a word that I could not be able to get into my lifelong life .
And I was looking for a lot of them to look at the faces of the brave , <unk> , <unk> , and , you know , look at the <unk> , and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not allowed to give you any advice .
I understood how much energy I felt about the power of the so-called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; moment .
And I &apos;m not really the real step with my <unk> player .
I changed the way that my family was in my family , and I was in the world .
So why do I have a job , which is the world &apos;s status ?
It &apos;s very simple .
And I hope that , as I say , that might be a good story , and there &apos;s one thing that I think is going to be more effective , and there &apos;s a lot of the work that I &apos;ve got to say about the other way around , and I &apos;m not a <unk> fan
In the presence of my mind , I chose to use my life as a way of using the process of being used to build a process of <unk> and <unk> .
I think that the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the golden rule are not knowing .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to take the time to the very poor , the more of my inner world .
As my dad , I &apos;m not sure , is the only place that I &apos;m going to be living in , and the way that I &apos;m going to go to the school is not the only place that I have to go to , that I &apos;m not in the middle of the road .
I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not like me .

<unk> ?
They took the name of the step , but I wanted to ask you to ask me , &quot; &quot; What is it that &apos;s called the <unk> in Arabic ? &quot; &quot; And I wanted to say that in the midst of the word , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is a sign in Arabic
Who is writing ? Who &apos;s going to be ? Well , no problem .
One day I sat in my restaurant , and I was sitting in the morning .
I was looking at the office and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> ?
He seemed to me to think about what was the word &quot; &quot; equal &quot; &quot; to me .
&quot; &quot; What is the <unk> ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; He answered , &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; He answered , &quot; &quot; What would it mean ? &quot; &quot; He answered him .
He said , &quot; &quot; Wow ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be born with the French &quot; &quot; ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , come on it ! &quot; &quot; The office said , &quot; &quot; Oh , come on .
It was the good news that he was doing , and he said , &quot; If I had the most challenging girl in the world , I wouldn &apos;t have the most challenging guy in the world ! &quot;
What do you think there &apos;s going to be when you &apos;re not supposed to talk about &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
My son , when I was two , my boy had come back to me and he was walking on the back of the room , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a <unk> .
It &apos;s the ability to give a speech .
I started thinking about it .
So this is what I did .
This is really the case , really , really hard to see .
I mean , they &apos;re not acting in the same way that they &apos;re in the media .
Could this be able to deal with another ?
How did we get there ?
But we have , like , there &apos;s a lot of people like us , but they &apos;re kind of like , you know , they &apos;re all holding up with their own , and they &apos;re just like , you know , they &apos;re just going to be <unk> and they &apos;re not getting them
I have to forget my own , my ideas , my ideas , my brothers and abilities .
The kids that were in the literature have become the best Americans in the world .
I think it &apos;s the only way I study the Arabic in Arabic .
Should I have forgotten to you ?
And I was there , right ?
While all of this , I tried to understand it , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to do it with my hands , and I didn &apos;t want to have a conversation with my hands .
The Arabic language is not giving us the answer .
It &apos;s not the language that we used to do , the moment we &apos;re used to the broad exploration of our university , and we &apos;re not used to the familiar exploration of our university , and that &apos;s not the language of the way we used to use .
And we did this , and they were our <unk> .
I mean , I don &apos;t use my wish to write my wish , so we don &apos;t have this water .
Don &apos;t want to be able to use the language of the culture , so we don &apos;t use it in the right order .
It &apos;s a reality .
But there &apos;s something more important than we think about .
It &apos;s a main language language .
And you &apos;re going to be thinking about the problem of being in the language of the different languages , and you &apos;re not supposed to be perfect at all .
In the language of language , the vocabulary of the vocabulary is a place to do when we &apos;re talking about the other language .
How ?
The first time that <unk> <unk> was using the first time in Arabic .
It was the idea of the little boy who was a little <unk> and <unk> , and the only thing that was unique about the essence of the was that the individual was <unk> .
So , when she was writing in the English language , she had its power .
And when you read English in English , you &apos;re always hearing the sign of the word &quot; &quot; reading in English , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re feeling that you &apos;re feeling that you are feeling .
You might be able to imagine that in English , you know , the guy in the English language , the <unk> , the <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
The second one is , if you want to kill , if you want to kill a mile , you can kill it , and one of the ways you can kill it is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a true thing that has been a common society .
The Germans , the <unk> , do the <unk> — these miles — these miles are in the realm of this celebration .
And the reason for that is that they are very clear to their own language .
They are essential to the point of this .
And they &apos;re using it to be used by a lot of money , and they &apos;re using a lot of money to develop language .
Who knows more ?
Well , we would have been able to do this in the world , and we would have to go to the world with the world , and we would have to travel to the world with the world .
And once again , the study of the building , the country , the thousands of people , were used to take their own hands , and the way that they were used to themselves , they were also using their own methods , and they were also seeing them out .
They kept their language .
Because if you take a product that &apos;s from the Latin , if you take a product , if you take a product that &apos;s not labeled in the language of the species , you don &apos;t know , and that &apos;s not the kind of crop they &apos;re going to be .
You don &apos;t believe it &apos;s going to be the local product .
They were able to be familiar , like we were in our own way , like we were in the present .
So they needed to be able to deal with themselves and to be able to do their own language .
But I say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; the <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I say , &quot; &quot; Do you remember what you &apos;re supposed to do ?
Don &apos;t you remember what it is , is it flat ?
And who is there , and how many of you have ever seen it .
The one thing that &apos;s going to be completely <unk> with us is not the way we do it .
Language is the kind of <unk> that our lives have created our lives and our empathy , our own lives .
So we say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , and so on , and so on .
It &apos;s not a single , two words or two or three words .
It &apos;s the idea that we have to think about how we &apos;re thinking about how we &apos;re thinking about how we &apos;re going to see ourselves , and how we do it , and how we think about how we can do it .
What is the orchestra of the world ?
You might say , well , you know , how did this person , or not ?
So I say , &quot; &quot; Well , I think that &apos;s a little bit like the water , the water , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Is it the way that we are ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , you &apos;re okay , and I &apos;m going to go and I &apos;m not going to go into space .
And that &apos;s what it means to be able to do something , to remember that .
I have a <unk> friend who &apos;s a senior <unk> .
I asked him , what about the work of a day ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , well , everything is good . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But I &apos;m going to tell her that she &apos;s going to work for her , and she &apos;s going to work for her every night , and she &apos;s trying to explain to her , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and then the word
The <unk> was , &quot; How much would you have to get people to understand ? &quot;
Who is going to do it ?
&quot; &quot; What am I going to say ? &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
So , we started thinking about it , and it &apos;s going to be a word that says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell him , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s the book , and I &apos;ve been trying to get my hands on the book , and I &apos;ve been trying to figure out how to bend my life and tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take my hands on the floor and I &apos;m just going to tell you that I &apos;m going to take my hands on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I got my hands on the idea of it ,
Just take that for me .
( Applause ) What are we doing for the kids ?
We can do this in a way that &apos;s the case of the community and the community , and we have to do it for the <unk> of the community .
And so , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , why would you say , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
It &apos;s just a bit of a genius , and it &apos;s fun to make . &quot; &quot; And the problem is , &quot; &quot; The problem is not .
I was the same sign of the camp of the <unk> of the camp : &quot; I think you &apos;ve got to come from the rock , &apos; you are the ones who are not the same as you are . &quot;
We said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be able to do it either . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know about it either , because we don &apos;t have the same time , because we don &apos;t have the ability to cope .
And if I want to talk to you about that , I can tell you that Arabic is in Arabic .
We don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t have to change our reality , and we are able to change our dreams , and we are able to do our lives .
And we can &apos;t see the status quo and the way we think of it .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a believer from my head , but I &apos;m not a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he was a place in the middle .
And so , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s also creative and compelling .
And then we started to get a little bit of this in the room , and we started to get a <unk> .
You see , if you &apos;re seeing this , you &apos;re not going to see the language of the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the yellow face of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t kill the language . &quot; &quot; And the only thing about that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then you don &apos;t have to see the word &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; and the other one , and the other one , &quot;
Why ? The music is , the language is killed .
We don &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we were to kill our language , we would have to maintain our own .
We can keep our own .
We would have to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s a serious thing to lose and to be present in the future .
And then we started with the girls &apos; images of boys , and we had the images of the girls .
They &apos;re the pictures of girls and girls .
We &apos;re going to have a lot of money .
And who , too , says , &quot; &quot; Ah , you don &apos;t have a reputation . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to have a lot of different colors . &quot; &quot; But you know , you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , you &apos;re better . &quot; &quot; But you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re better . &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; The Internet is &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to fill the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because we &apos;re not supposed to be our own .
But as it comes forward , it &apos;s a question of if we can &apos;t believe that the more we have , the more bigger and more and more likely to think about the future , the more that we have , the more you can do , and the way you think about it .
It &apos;s a great idea .
But if we don &apos;t fly the universe , we can &apos;t see if we can &apos;t fly , and we can &apos;t be able to do it .
And yet , you &apos;re a great architect .
It &apos;s a map of the universe in which you have a space .
We can start to see the future .
We &apos;re going to create a short story novel , a short film .
And it &apos;s a novel that can make us new .
And this allows you to go through the audience and make sure that the Arabic of Arabic is going to be a new way .
We have a way to say , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , there &apos;s no way .
But we need to know , and we need to believe that the way we &apos;re going to do it , the way we think about it , is that we have a debt .
And so , what can you do today ?
<unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> ?
And the next thing that I &apos;m going to do is , you know , I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that I &apos;m going to spend more than anything else , like , you know , God , or whatever .
But don &apos;t worry about the same as the traditional number of books in Arabic in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is a real purpose , this is not language .
You &apos;re going to be able to get into the viral world .
And it &apos;s not easy to say that it &apos;s not easy to get back into a space .
This is the first job we can do .
The second thing is , there &apos;s a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not just going to have a conversation with this day .
We are here to show that we can &apos;t do the importance of this language .
So I &apos;m going to tell you about something .
The blind one is the same as the horse is passed .
My daughter was born , I would say to him , &quot; &quot; This is the creation of this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be very , very good at
( Applause ) So , the way we &apos;re doing this is by the way to make this happen . ( Applause )
And so , a few years ago , I was thinking about this , and this is a few of the great American <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I learned a few things about this , and I learned a few things about this .
And the last time that the bear was going to be the same , the more or less there was the time that the day was going to be .
I was a picture of a day , and I was a picture of the day .
I think it &apos;s a little bit more like a human being .
I was also taught to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure that you can see the world , but the only thing that &apos;s going on is the way you think about it .
And so , by the way , we have the ability to do this without having to write the word of the day .
But you &apos;ll be able to get the novel .
It &apos;s too bad .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I am a computer . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to have a <unk> .
I can say , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; I don &apos;t want to write . &quot;
I learned that it was too small , that it was very , very small to me , and I could have been to my own .
And , you know , they &apos;re so much fun .
( Applause )
The first day I started to <unk> my journey , and I was able to make a sense of the fact that I was going to be a <unk> , and I was a <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
I was a <unk> , very high school , and I started working with the idea of love , and I began to live in a life of love and a whole lot of the work that I had .
It was a very compelling image , a very compelling image , and it was a real quality of the conversation that was being sent to the information that was a high energy and a half .
And if I was to , I was very happy that I would have been very happy with the people who were being <unk> , and I was scared of the same , and I was scared of the future .
But I learned that the law was good .
It was so hard to get the fear of the <unk> , so I had to know that I was in the first <unk> , and I was just finishing the first <unk> , two , three , and so on .
I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , as I was a kid , I was a kid , and I was a kid , and I would spend a lot of time with my wife , &quot; &quot; I was struck by the <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I
There was no matter who was in the role of the <unk> , and the epiphany was to be <unk> .
In <unk> , the book is in the sand .
&quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s open . &quot; &quot; — I was equal .
It was a beginning .
And the day before , the day I was in the mail , I was talking about the third woman , and she was working on the third woman .
&quot; &quot; Oh , he &apos;s going to get the thing .
And so , when I was looking for the truth , it was a bit of a search for pleasure and a community of hope and hope , and I decided to give you an amazing amount of empathy .
I was reminded of the fact that I was going to have my own experience and my faith in my life , and my feeling for real feeling .
I didn &apos;t feel about the past , but I felt that my feeling of feeling , my <unk> , was in my inner body .
I was just a bit of a senior and I was just one of the senior men .
And I had this great responsibility to go forward : the normal people , the people that were not supposed to be seen , and the reason I was equal to that was a great deal .
And so I got a little too poor to come to the class , and I decided to go out and I was going to get a lot of my own .
I &apos;m not going to show you how I &apos;m doing my college .
And as I was a geek , I saw myself in the <unk> <unk> , and as I said , I was going to listen to the fact that he was holding up the side of my life , and he &apos;d come back to the place where he was going to stay on
I had to have this and I needed this , and I started to speak to my inner inner bar .
And so , I was thinking about the fact that I was in the process of doing this .
And I was also thinking , and it was like , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m a member of the community , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit like this , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that you are
For the past , I worked like a woman , &quot; &quot; I worked like the <unk> website , &quot; &quot; and I was like , &quot; &quot; I want to admit , I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go to the interview ,
I don &apos;t have to sing in <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to read .
And then , when I got out of the way , I started to get out of the way .
I was struck by the fact that I was a veteran , and I was thinking about , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to show you the same : the greatest confusion of my self , and the reason for that , is that the attribute of a product and the self of the future .
I was thinking about the fact that I was not working with the experience of my grandmother , but the fear of being a product of the product was the subject of the treatment .
And this is a kind of <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> , and it &apos;s a kind of a <unk> , and it started to step up and started to step up and roll it into the crowd .
I was a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> world , and I was a <unk> .
For example , if I had a suggestion , I would have been able to make life , and to make sure that I was going to change the way that they could change , and to make sure that they were kind of like a <unk> , a kind of a <unk> .
The first time we &apos;ve got a few <unk> , as three to three , as they were three , and then they were very interesting , and we were able to do it , and we were able to get the &quot; &quot; hope &quot; &quot; ?
Do you see the stock water ?
I was going to tell you the story of the teacher in the school , and I was going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make it , &quot; &quot; and this is the light that I &apos;m going to show you .
In the last year , I was not a <unk> , and I was not a <unk> , and I was not in the trouble with the reason that I was hearing about this , that I was not in the West .
And after two years , he started to get started .
I &apos;ve been a whole lot of the world : the weather , the familiar , the <unk> , the strange , whatever .
I was a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> , and I had a <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> , and he was a <unk> , and he was an artist , and he was writing , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more comfortable with schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And the more <unk> , the <unk> and I used to be able to break my head to the table .
Now , I think that &apos;s the case of the discovery of the past , and look at the hope of the fact that there &apos;s a lot of hope for the fact that there &apos;s a lot of money .
And the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and he &apos;d come up with a little bit of me , and I would have to say , I &apos;d be a little bit older than that .
And I was in the presence of a lot of people , and the more people I got , the more I got , but the audience was very appealing , but I was very excited by the fact that I was going to have a good job of being a woman .
I &apos;m struck by another voice , and my partner and my partner , after never been challenged , is that the right moment to be able to get to her and to her , to her , to her , to her , to her , to her , to her , to her , to her , to the extent , to her , to the extent , to the extent that I had to go back to her in the way that I had to go to her life ,
The thing that &apos;s going to happen is that Eleanor will do that .
If you have a degree in the class , it &apos;s going to come out of the closet , and when I got to the point where I got to work , it would be , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a good deal , and it &apos;s just a little bit like this , and it &apos;s not just that you &apos;re willing to go back to the <unk> and the <unk> .
But they were stuck in the spirit of the inner spirit , the inner spirit , the <unk> .
I was just like , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;d been trying to find out that I &apos;ve been a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been told that I &apos;m a bit of a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been surprised to see that there &apos;s some young people who are in childhood , who are always familiar with the same issues . &quot; &quot; And I realized that the problem was that the problem was a
Of course , early on , I was very fortunate to believe that when I was traveling , I was very hard to believe that I was going to be able to read it , and I &apos;d be able to tell you that I was actually a little bit of a genius , and I was really learning to do my own journey .
I was able to tell you that I was going to study the same thing as a house — not just as the reality of the house , but as I was feeling the fear of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
I believed in them .
I &apos;m not sure if I ever had a chance to live the lives of my parents &apos; home , I was also sitting in the &apos; 90s , and I was in the &apos; 60s .
So , I was a very young woman in the room for me , and I was a very poor guy , and I was a little bit of a mess , and I was a little bit like a gun , and I was a little bit of a mess .
It &apos;s not just that you &apos;re going to be doing it .
Can you see that plastic ? &quot; &quot; I was like , &quot; &quot; I have plastic ? That &apos;s my way .
And then I had to tell them that I would have a lot of faith in the conversation , like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been more aware of the same way : I would love to have a better choice for them , but I would have to do it anyway . &quot; &quot; I would thank you to do what I did in the world , and I would have to say , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you have a situation where you can do it in the midst of
I started to get to the <unk> and the <unk> , and I began to ask them to look at the <unk> , but I began to think about the possibility of being able to learn what was going on .
I was able to learn that I didn &apos;t have any solutions to the fact that I could never solve any of these things and never get the <unk> of my life , the <unk> , the shame and my essence .
I was able to find out that these wounds , these wounds , are in the name of the kind of thing that I think are the most important and courageous voices of the sky , and that &apos;s the way that the most important thing is the sheer design of the adventure .
After that , I had a <unk> , which is that , in the <unk> of the <unk> , I had a <unk> , and I had a <unk> , and I was back on the <unk> of the <unk> .
And after about 10 years , when I was a kid , I was struck by the fact that the highest degree of success in the history of college was the most high minimum , and then I got the most violent , <unk> <unk> , and I got the most valuable <unk> in the world .
And one of the things that I was going to do was , I was a little bit more nervous about the fact that I was in the middle of nowhere .
I &apos;m not familiar with the fact that they are not allowed to do anything .
As a matter of fact , it was a great thing to do with the fact that you could see the people in the world who were not really familiar with the same thing .
We can &apos;t see the two weeks of the two .
I &apos;ve been doing this in the middle of the book , and I &apos;ve been able to do the same , and I &apos;ve been able to show you that the greatest question that you might find in the middle of the <unk> is that there &apos;s no good at the same thing , and it &apos;s not the answer , but it &apos;s not the answer .
I &apos;ve learned to live in all of this in the world , and I &apos;ve learned to live in a way that I &apos;ve never seen , that the beauty and the banking force of the world is going to increase .
I could help others who would have been a bit of an alien , but I could help others .
In the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the city , the <unk> of the creation of the brand , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the very hard and the important , important , important skills that they
And it &apos;s a question that &apos;s been calculated that if you have a full time and a sense of self , it &apos;s a very , very small thing to do with understanding the public self .
This is possible to be a human , a bit of a genius , a <unk> .
And there &apos;s a word that &apos;s called the <unk> change , which is why , when you start to think about the change , it doesn &apos;t get into the mind .
It &apos;s not going to be a person .
It &apos;s not going to be a human being that &apos;s not going to be afraid .
I mean , I think that the more people are going to be the professional and the world is not the only way to change the world , but the world is not going to be able to change the world .
In the last 20 years , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the spiritual people , the hope that people are doing , and the hope is that people who have a hard time getting a hard time and <unk> and <unk> .
As a matter of fact , it &apos;s a very <unk> place to use , to use this to use the <unk> of the human right to use this , to use the <unk> .
It &apos;s a great thing to do with our community , to help us with the health care of someone who &apos;s left , to be able to have health , to be able to extend the kindness of somebody , to be able to cut off the kindness and to the health .
We need to be able to live , to be able to live , to remember , to remember .
We are <unk> . We &apos;re not feeling .
We &apos;re not going to take the thing out of our apartment and go to the front .
The light is not the same .
One of the eye , who said to me , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s your mind ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about what you &apos;re seeing in your life .
It &apos;s about the time . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk about my attending .
But what is it that &apos;s going to be ?
Because of course , you can &apos;t get a picture of it , and you can &apos;t get a picture of it .
And so , I was like , I &apos;m a little girl , when I got a list of my <unk> , my first <unk> .
I was surrounded by this , I was able to plan with my own artists , because I had a process of using a video that was using a camera to do it .
And if you &apos;re a picture of a photograph of a million , you can see that the ring is ready to be .
And so , if you were to , you know , the picture was just the right thing to do .
I thought , I would do that .
So , I wanted to make something different , and it &apos;s something that started to work after after the image of the architect .
And the picture is that , in a way , the <unk> is the key to the way .
But it &apos;s a very clear game .
And it &apos;s not just that , but it looks real .
Or movies — a lot of them are also a dark , but also a dark , seemingly common way of getting into the ground .
And I think , in the case of the <unk> , we don &apos;t mind .
Because , of course , I have been able to show you that images aren &apos;t really , but I have to show you a picture of what &apos;s going on with the camera .
I have to show you some images that you might have to get to understand .
So it &apos;s a challenge that you can keep in the way that you &apos;re actually holding it in a more intuitive way .
What is it that &apos;s the way that they can look at the fact that they can ?
Does it ever happen to those with the biofuels ?
Is it okay to do ?
What is the cow of the self-esteem ?
It &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> .
But then the probe is the beginning of how to understand the world , two <unk> on the two .
It &apos;s really what this means is really what it means to be really , really understanding what it looks like .
So , the change is simple .
I see this in a place that I &apos;ve seen a lot of the world &apos;s promise to be a real , practical , independent real creature .
I &apos;m showing you a simple example .
There &apos;s a physical basis that you have in three dimensions here , three <unk> of three-dimensional worlds .
But in a certain sense , it seems like three three-dimensional objects that have been there .
And we know that we can &apos;t have .
So , we play the game with our brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t necessarily know the self .
And I see the same process as a photograph of the sky .
And these are actually the kind of different reality that actually is going to come to a place .
So the things that we &apos;re going to think about are the things that we &apos;re seeing , the things that are happening in our daily lives , the things that we &apos;re thinking about
And when I &apos;m going to show you a picture of what &apos;s happening , it &apos;s really important to do , because in the case of the universe , it looks a little bit
What I like to say is that there are three simple ways that we can actually make a difference to the present .
As you see , there &apos;s no particular point in these images .
But in a moment , something happens .
So the first thing that we have , the first one , is that the very many can be the same as the <unk> .
Secondly , the light has to be the same for the light .
And these two sides are two <unk> , and the same light is on the same light .
And third , the pattern of the television is not going to be able to do the same , the one that &apos;s going to be made of the other end of the next year .
It &apos;s a place where the things that matter to be made of what the world is .
We have a lot of <unk> images , and we have a lot of time in the middle of the continent , and we can make a sense of whether it &apos;s a picture of the Earth &apos;s , and we can see that the trajectory between the two and the other pictures , the real estate , the <unk>
This is another one .
( Laughter ) People think that this is the way that it &apos;s a <unk> and change , and it &apos;s the bottom line that &apos;s been there .
But in fact , this picture , which is a picture of the universe , has been created , has been created in a way that you can &apos;t put together .
You know , it &apos;s a place where you can &apos;t have a place where you can &apos;t find a place , and you don &apos;t need to have a sense of what you &apos;re going to do in your own .
But it &apos;s a lot of planning .
And I would like to tell you that I &apos;ve been a few months old , and I know that I have a few months of doing the same puzzle for finding places where I can find different places .
For example , the elephant is a <unk> .
And they &apos;re different .
He &apos;s a <unk> in the middle of a mountain .
And I painted that , I would paint the house of the island , the home , the more likely to look like the other .
So , to me , it &apos;s possible to make a point of view , which is that it &apos;s possible to make a point .
And then , every time a button comes out , it starts with an idea .
And then it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> .
In this case , it &apos;s all a bit of a <unk> .
And if you &apos;re good at the movies , the results are bright , and they can also be quite <unk> .
So we have all the things that we need to do , and the thing that drives us is our approach .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian , you &apos;re not going to hit it .
So you could have created a data that was given a data , a great deal of data , a lot of information about the entire world &apos;s population .
Is this possible ?
Julian <unk> : Yeah , that &apos;s right ?
The world is going to be a great business of how the world &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , and it &apos;s a little <unk> that &apos;s going to spread across the world .
CA : So how do you do that ?
People are watching these things .
What about the Mississippi sector ?
JA : These are the things that we know about the information that we know about , and there are different ways to make these data .
So , to take a step back , to get the information that &apos;s going to be encrypted , to actually take information out , to address the laws of the laws of law , to the Swedish and the state of the country .
It &apos;s a little bit like the public or the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> , the <unk> , the format that &apos;s spreading into the <unk> — and it can be — it &apos;s a little bit hard to put on the ground , and we &apos;re going to have to be a little bit more about the political
CA : So , you know , you &apos;ve got the majority of the information , you know , because you don &apos;t know who &apos;s the way to do it .
JA : That &apos;s right . We know them . If we can &apos;t get the information that &apos;s going to be the gift of the rescue , we get them to know .
( Laughter ) <unk> <unk> : <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the whole thing — it &apos;s the TED code . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> .
This is the information that was leaked years ago .
So , here &apos;s the idea .
It was a story from Kenya .
Can you talk about this story about your own leak ?
JA : This is the <unk> <unk> .
It was a survey that was taken by the country , after 2004 , and then the government was named .
He was recently moved by the <unk> <unk> , who was 18 years old , who was working 18 years ago .
I was a <unk> manager .
They &apos;ve taken a <unk> of the power of the <unk> , which is the power of two million <unk> of the <unk> .
The art and the most <unk> people in this place have been using the same , which is the most capable of the right guy .
It &apos;s like a Kenyan <unk> of the Kenyan <unk> Act .
In 2007 , 28 years ago , I had a chance to do it , and I had to do it .
This would be this , in the new age of a new new hand , and we started to get the next one day after three days of the <unk> , and this is the case of the account of the year after this .
CA : So , the only thing that happened is that a long word for the discussion press is not a place to go , because you could think of it as the way that it was . And it was the result of the result .
JA : Yeah . The X minister of the <unk> , after the first <unk> , was in the country , in the country , in Tanzania , in the presence of the world .
The X was from the X-rays .
And in a few days , the press had a conversation about the conversation that was about to be the perfect .
And the 20 days of Kenya , published Kenya in Kenya , and the exponential news of democracy , which was the result of the data , was led to the situation that the result would change the outcome of the elected consequences .
CA : So the information that you would literally use , is the knowledge of the world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : And this is the video that you have to do , which is the air of the <unk> .
The whole point is a little too long . This is a short clip of the story .
And the first one is , there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a problem in this video .
Radio : ... and it &apos;s a little bit of a turn to the top .
Now , look , the same thing looks like .
The Moon is the Moon . It &apos;s .
When you see the act , it &apos;s like the news .
He &apos;s hit his belly .
The king , the horse !
( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> . ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) I &apos;m not going to get away from the same weapon .
Hello . Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six .
And then we had to go to the next point .
We killed eight , we killed eight .
There &apos;s two <unk> , we &apos;re going to push it out .
It was . It died .
We &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — we &apos;re in the middle of the line .
Oh , <unk> . What is it ?
Zimbabwe , Khia . Ah , he &apos;s conflicted , hygiene .
CA : So , what about the imagery of this video ?
JA : That &apos;s the great thing about people who were in this business .
And this is a <unk> that was connected to the number of people in the team .
This is one of three of the three cells in the video .
CA : And so , what would I have to do with the two on this one , when you were going to get in the morning two on the other side ?
JA : Well , two <unk> workers died , two children were born .
And the man died , and he died .
CA : So this is why it caused the site to be the first to introduce this .
What did you do with this , and what was the reason for the dead ?
JA : I know that I &apos;ve seen people realize that people have an strength .
People who are comfortable with the <unk> of the people who feel comfortable with the <unk> — and they &apos;re not — they &apos;re not a — they &apos;re not — they &apos;re not a good one — they &apos;re not even a <unk> .
There was two words that were not trained as the laws of being who were being watched .
CA : The U.S. security Achendy Manning was infected , and he noticed that there were 280,000 U.S. dollars in the survey room , and we &apos;re going to keep telling you about the writing of the 280,000 U.S. economy .
I mean , did he ?
JA : We &apos;re not able to get these printers .
Five days ago , before we had a <unk> , we were <unk> .
This year , the head of the United States has published the head of the United States , but it doesn &apos;t have to do with it .
And I &apos;ve been working on this mess .
CA : And so , if you were to have the <unk> , what would you say to the US ?
JA : And we wrote them . ( CA : We were taking them . ) CA : Well , we were able to do it . ( Laughter ) JA : So , you know , people are in the business of the United States , and they &apos;re all familiar with the people in the country
The key things are actually these kinds of materials .
CA : So , I &apos;m talking about this as a little bit of responsibility .
In my mind , is it that you have a ideology ?
Do you think that &apos;s the right account for the invention of the art ?
JA : There &apos;s a question that you can &apos;t have for the world , but it &apos;s important to have a sense of turning back to the world .
The trend is very much .
The key to the economic power of the economic growth is that we have the ability to find out about the fact that there &apos;s a new and good quality of innovation that &apos;s going to be available , and it &apos;s a good thing to do to bring themselves to the users of the institutions that are
It &apos;s about the <unk> . It &apos;s a scanning of <unk> of the <unk> .
CA : But if you don &apos;t have a little bit of safety , people don &apos;t have to be the same as the fact that you &apos;re not born with you , but you can &apos;t even have a bad password for all of the community .
JA : Which is what we &apos;re going to do in the data .
So we have the political policy to get out of the ground .
The irony is , we have a lot of people who are watching the face of the Titanic .
There &apos;s a list of laws — the same reason , the laws of the ego , the laws of the laws , but what we do is we do the best of the people that we know what they &apos;re doing .
CA : You know , it &apos;s all good .
If you were to have a conversation with the United States of America , you would have been talking about a lot of people who would say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , who &apos;s trying to do it , you know ? &quot; &quot; And the video is , you know , &quot; &quot;
And the people who are facing the project are dying of dying .
This is not the human being show that the human experience of a <unk> is not human . It &apos;s not a natural sense of the human experience .
My son is no longer . How do you get me ? &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re asking me , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to be doing it ?
JA : Well , it &apos;s very much like us .
But if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see that the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they don &apos;t need to see this video .
It &apos;s not that they change the idea of their ideas , and they don &apos;t change the way they feel .
Today , they see it every day .
And so , this is the case for the extraordinary fortune of being given money to the occasion , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to call .
CA : So , you &apos;ve got to think about the government and the companies , the secret to the government and the companies .
It &apos;s good to contract .
But the thing that I was interested in was that you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to have to be invisible .
JA : It &apos;s not . It &apos;s not about being a <unk> .
Or we can &apos;t do that , but we have the data that &apos;s going to be the ones that have the resources that are in the world .
If they think about it , they might be hard to do , and we can do it for us , and we &apos;re trying to make sure that we &apos;re going to make a job that we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re doing something that is so much more like our work .
CA : And so what kind of reason I &apos;m interested in — I &apos;m like , what do you think they &apos;re doing , and what do they think about it ?
There &apos;s two kinds of ideas and <unk> about the future .
One — the light is the light bulbs .
The second is dangerously neglected .
Who &apos;s going to think that they &apos;re born ?
What about the world &apos;s status ?
JA : Well , it &apos;s not even a guy .
CA : That &apos;s people , Julian , Julian .
We &apos;re going to have to work a little bit more . You &apos;ll see it .
I think that &apos;s the one that I &apos;ve been at the end of the year , but it &apos;s going to be published .
Is it a strange factor of a place in which it &apos;s a strange one ?
What is this ?
JA : That &apos;s a process that we all saw .
The late year — the last year in the <unk> , the <unk> , has been known as the <unk> , but not the strong , but the same .
We have a model that has been given up to the team , and the way that the competition is going to be the place of building the <unk> of the organizations that are the masters of the <unk> .
And there was a great deal of the way that the obesity government was working and the other side of the world .
The moment the scientist was born , he was not a little bit of a date .
We didn &apos;t know what was writing , and we didn &apos;t know what was going on .
We have a few short students , and the game of the <unk> company can also be the game of the company .
And so , we &apos;ve got to think , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit <unk> , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit <unk> .
We don &apos;t know about it .
It &apos;s the right thing . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to have a little bit of a conversation with the idea of writing , and we &apos;re not going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be able to get the information out of the company , but we &apos;re going to know the company — ( Laughter ) — and we &apos;re going to have to find
What about documentation ?
Is it the essence of the laws ?
You know , you &apos;re not ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , the computer is not the same as the way you can .
Yeah .
( Applause ) And the ones that I have , the more we do .
One of the ways that the printing press is one of the methods is that it &apos;s one of the methods of writing .
CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a lot of them , but they &apos;re also doing the same thing , and they &apos;re doing it in the lab .
We have reduced the experience of the past few months to stop the laws of our ideas , to stop them from new ones , to help us to overcome our lives .
This is a little problem .
The technology that we &apos;ve come to do in new ways is to push our burden in a way that is very good , even though there &apos;s a lot of information , and we have no idea how we can do it .
CA : So what you need to do is make sure that you have a lot of money with the laws of the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
JA : Yeah . We &apos;re people who we believe .
And the data that we have , the data that we have in our lives , is that there &apos;s a hard situation to be able to do things with a lot of other things , and it &apos;s a pressure of the security that will allow us to go into
CA : So , you might say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you could say that this started to work ?
I read that in the Wall War , which is the age of 37 school .
Can that be right ?
JA : My favorite ones were the ones that were in the Bible , and I was a religious artist .
( Laughter ) CA : Pyxis didn &apos;t naturally put that into banking .
JA : So , hold up the picture of the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : Because you &apos;ve been a genius , you &apos;re a big geek , you &apos;re a big problem .
JA : I was a great golfer .
You know , I was one of the youngstar journalists .
I was shocked when I was a kid , when I was a kid .
There &apos;s a need to be a little more resourceful .
We can make things with the way we can .
Unfortunately , the <unk> of all cows , who are the <unk> of the <unk> , who are the ones that are doing the last time you &apos;ve been paying for the Russians .
It &apos;s not like a <unk> long time ago .
CA : I don &apos;t think you have a lot of time in the first place , but what are the things that are the things that you &apos;ve made ? What are the things that are the things that are the things ?
Can you give them a short data , or you can give them a hint , or do you talk about them ?
JA : I think that &apos;s the case .
But I am also the ones that can help make people go , and people are helping to create makers .
I was a father , I know , with a little bit of small people , and I was able to study people .
CA : Together , you can &apos;t create a human embryo ; you &apos;re using them ?
JA : I &apos;m not a person who &apos;s a little bit convicted , I &apos;m standing in the face of the <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to show you the <unk> , but in order to get people to be able to do it — I &apos;m not
This is a <unk> I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : Have you ever talked about a few minutes to talk about what happened in the last few minutes ?
And the thing that you can publish there is that the data has been given a problem , and it &apos;s been given the fact that the news is going to be the key to the Sun .
Instead , they publicized your side .
You &apos;ve made good good for the Lego . What happened ?
JA : That was a big issue .
The name of the economy was the economy .
It was one of the largest <unk> from the world .
The bank &apos;s dirty product was 10 times further than another operation .
And this is the study of the year after the study .
And so , when the movie was published on the Web , the first thing that happened was that the early days of the day , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , and he didn &apos;t know what to do , and he said , &quot; &quot; No , no , I &apos;ve never been to the class . Why haven &apos;t we been done ? &quot;
We were published in the <unk> , and we were published in the <unk> , and we were talking about the fact that we were going to have a conversation .
And so , if you could have a better chance of the community , then , as a matter of fact , a few of the poems that were given to the <unk> political literacy , then the president of the British <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the new laws of the Royal Society , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the law , and the
The president of the Royal Society of <unk> knew that the country was not going to be addressed .
And this was the first time in the history of Congress that was just in the middle of the closet .
CA : I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to do this .
( Applause ) So , let &apos;s take a look at the <unk> water .
What if you believe that what you &apos;re going to do is to do what you &apos;re going to do , and what will be your favorite way to do anything , or how to get the wrong thing , or the other way around ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure why it &apos;s happened .
In the world of all , the world &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> , in the United States , is the one that will be used to address the poor and the <unk> of the United States .
It &apos;s hard to see what the future is .
It &apos;s a very interesting thing that we live in . We can change everything .
CA : Now , I think you &apos;ve got to think about what our religious brains mean , and that &apos;s the <unk> , the strength , the power of the universe .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Make a great deal . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to write a text .
I want to tell you a story about the story , and I want to tell you a little bit about the story of the story , and I &apos;m not a little bit about the problem of violence .
But let me talk about the story of the story that I &apos;ve never begun before .
I &apos;m going to use it to say , in a way , a <unk> , a <unk> — and you &apos;ll come to a couple of the things that I &apos;m going to talk about .
In the meantime , I &apos;m born with the kind of <unk> family .
And I &apos;m going to take my parents &apos; time , and I &apos;m going to be a guy , and I &apos;m a guy , and I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m a victim .
I &apos;ve been living in a way that I &apos;ve been living at a moment of age .
In the 1970s , it was a little bit weird .
I was the family of the family family family , who was a member of the family , who was a member of his family , who was a young man in the <unk> .
I was the same as the women of the world , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not the only one who &apos;s going to be the same .
In other words , I &apos;ve always been waiting for my attention , religious , less and less , my granddaughters .
On the other hand , I was always the <unk> , religious , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m really troubled by the fact that the artist has been replaced by a senior , and he &apos;s been able to see the <unk> of the eye in the wild .
The truth , the <unk> , who was carrying out on the ground , was to go into the crowd .
And yet , every time , when you were a senior , it would be a <unk> , and it would take a lot of girls to come to the bottom of the tank .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you were to put a bunch of keys on the ground , you would have a conversation with the idea of a <unk> .
After a week , they were going to be the <unk> .
I know that I know that this is not a good story , but I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever had a chance to talk about the human , or the other , but the other is not the kind of dark or the person who has left the other person &apos;s hands .
What did I say ? What was the strength of this praying man ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there are a lot of prayer , but it &apos;s a law of the same way that the building is the power of the most . &quot; &quot; And then we have a lot of evidence , and there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , and if you want to go to the next generation , we need to have a lot of potential , whether it &apos;s
It &apos;s just a little bit of a waste .
All of us are in the presence of cultural and cultural heritage .
We are all in the room .
We are born with a lot of our own , a family , nation , class .
But if we don &apos;t know that we have a living in the world , we can &apos;t see the Earth in the distant environment , and we can see that it &apos;s going to be the risk of spreading from the outside .
So , we can have a little bit of power , we can &apos;t get it to the ground , we &apos;re very long at the beginning of the human being , and we &apos;re seeing the human being .
Our friends , our neighbors , our sons , our family , our family , and they are very similar to our own self , and we are very familiar with ourselves .
As I say , women are going to do something , and they &apos;re going to make it happen , they &apos;re <unk> , or they &apos;re going to fall in the middle of the day , or the <unk> of the day .
The belief that this is supposed to be a rock in the neighborhood , it &apos;s not hard to see any human being .
And it &apos;s a very strange thing to do , and it &apos;s one of the greatest <unk> of our world &apos;s greatest security , and it &apos;s about the greatest amount of global our world we share .
And it &apos;s the beginning of the work , the liberals and the liberals and the gods , the people and the people , the people who are in the middle of the room .
We &apos;ve been here to see the problems of the kinds of problems that are the most important and the things that are the ones that have been created .
And the idea is that the art that I have , the more I have the same , is the way that these penguins are .
It can open the sites , and it can open up the sites in the middle of our galaxy .
And we can see from these things , and we can see the other world .
I started writing stories from eight .
One day , my mother gave me a little bit of my life and her personal arms , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you the story of the writing .
Now , I think that I think that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> .
I was a family , but I was a very good one to my family , and I was not talking about my friends , but I was told to go to my <unk> friends .
I was a kid who was going to be a <unk> and I was a kid , and I was a <unk> kid , and I was a kid , and I was a kid , and I was a kid , and I was a kid .
But I didn &apos;t know that I was going to believe that I was a bit of a <unk> , and I was going to try and figure out what I was going to do , and I would have been asked to write about my very existence .
I started writing about this , and I began to write about things that were not about the issues and the things that were not about the things that were happening .
I started writing the world &apos;s love for my own love .
And the only thing that was going on was that they were different stories , and they were different stories of their own neighbors .
Just take a look at the world : Don &apos;t make it all the way to my <unk> .
And this was a kind of thing that was called a <unk> .
And I was a diplomat .
I was also reminded , this little , <unk> , <unk> school in the middle of the night , and I was in the middle of the brain , and I was in the middle of the school .
The first one I &apos;d say is that I have children who say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was having children in the field of every single mile , but it was a bit of a responsibility to show that there was a real time in the world .
Now , in this case , they were asking themselves to be more successful , not their own , but rather than their own .
We were like a lot of the foreign nations , and it was fun , but it was also a bad sign , and it was a little bit of a <unk> , and it was a little bit tricky .
I was always confused by the same as the child , the <unk> .
And I was like , well , if this was a school , I had a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> of the organization , the <unk> , and the <unk> music , was made of <unk> .
( Laughter ) I was a <unk> kid who was a <unk> kid .
And the first time I saw this in the middle of the school , I saw the concept of the culture .
And I asked all the kids , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t look at all the kids . &quot; &quot; They asked me to do a few nights , and they asked me to do a couple of my own , and they would all come out of the whole thing .
I learned about three ways of being connected by the mother , the world , the idea that politics and the head of the world .
After Spain , we were going to the German and the new and the new .
And I thought , well , I would have thought , I &apos;ve been able to imagine the journey of my wife and my strength , and I &apos;ve got to think about the journey of the <unk> .
It was the kind of thing that I had to do , and it was kind of the sense of responsibility and sense of the sense that I felt that I was not feeling feeling <unk> .
I was a <unk> , very strong , in my city .
I was living in a living environment , and I lived in a living , and I wrote a picture of my novel .
I was there in the <unk> , and I was there with a <unk> .
I had the same picture that I saw in the middle of the day , and I had a standing , and I was standing in the middle of the street .
He was an elderly , an elderly , an older , <unk> , <unk> man , and he would talk about the living man and the man who died .
It was sitting next to a long white light , and it was sitting next to the trance of Titanic .
I saw that in the case of the night , I had a <unk> , and I found myself a single thing that was just a girl — I had a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
And when we &apos;re going to see the death and the dates of the mountain , we have a chance to take a thousand hours , and we &apos;ll be able to get all of our raw stuff .
I &apos;m not really convinced that there &apos;s a real <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to say that you have a strong sense of being a <unk> , but in reading , when we &apos;re reading a good novel , we &apos;re all going to be able to get away from our comfort room , and we &apos;re not going to have the same evidence that we &apos;re
And after the moment , I went to the school , and after the school , I went to the <unk> in the school .
It &apos;s not only a <unk> but it &apos;s a completely different way of seeing language .
I started to write in English .
I &apos;m a sophomore , and I &apos;m very interested in the fact that England asked me to be able to change my English language , and my writing , I can &apos;t change my name .
I like to write a word , and my characters and <unk> become more and more <unk> , and I think I &apos;m like , I think , more and more and more of the science and self .
I think I think I &apos;m just hearing about hearing .
I &apos;ve learned that English is a million people in the world , and I &apos;ve learned that English is a language of English .
When you learn language , you &apos;re a very different approach to learning .
And then , as we go older , we tend to be more often talking to people , and better adults , we want to make better choices , because we &apos;re less than a little bit of our brain and our language .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re all worried about .
But we can learn from it to learn , to the extent , to the point .
And that was the way I learned in Boston — and I was a real , and I was a <unk> .
I could have spent a year with my entire time in the same way that I had to go to the situation of the day , and I would have been able to get a home in the same way that I could get my home , and then I would have been able to get a home in a place where it &apos;s the most forgotten place .
I was living in a family called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; for the most part .
( Laughter ) But I went to the point where I was going to get a privilege .
And I started to realize that there was a <unk> in the <unk> , and I was able to find out about the other two of the world &apos;s <unk> points .
I &apos;m part of a part of my physical , <unk> , physical and physical .
I &apos;m thinking about the fact that I &apos;m going to share all the American and pieces of music and all of my pieces .
I think that the story of the story is that when you &apos;re more aware of the story , it &apos;s the ability to get your awareness more .
I would like to give you the idea that this is the case .
One of the things that I did was I went to the stage where there was a lot of light out there , and it was a little bit of a promise to the American people .
&quot; &quot; The story of the book &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; You &apos;ve got to get a little bit of a different type of paper . &quot;
( Laughter ) I would ask for a little bit of it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , we &apos;ve got a lot of money , there &apos;s a lot of people , there &apos;s a lot of money , American , America , and there &apos;s one thing that people do . &quot; &quot; The Boston Boston won &apos;t do a refugee camp in Boston than there were , and I think that &apos;s what the other people have done .
But I know that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to go to it .
He wanted me to become my personal monastery .
It meant that I wanted to be a member of the kind of <unk> that I was talking about .
We talk about the world , and we talk about the world , and we can &apos;t see the world , and we can also see the impact of the African world .
The text is so often that the text is not a little bit too far from the same .
If you &apos;re female , you can &apos;t tell the story about the Islam , the fear of Islam , the fear of Islam , but the more you can get to the American women .
And the more <unk> , the sad , typical story , the <unk> , the <unk> of the audience .
I &apos;m also a writer in the literature of the world that I &apos;ve seen in the world in Madrid .
The software is not as people who are the ideas of the art and the country , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the one that &apos;s a little bit more than a city .
Our feminism is not the fault , but the way we &apos;re seeing is that our culture is not .
In the time he took the picture and launched the story of the Royal James <unk> , he asked him questions about the <unk> of homosexuality .
And when he got to the top of the world , he was running on the blue , and he said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t see it , and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You know , you can &apos;t see anything that &apos;s not in other parts of the room , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s any other thing in the other side of the world
There &apos;s a great <unk> in which all the players who are not being born without any <unk> are being used to be a genius .
I &apos;ve been hearing very early in the early days of my Harvard , which is the first of many decades of the early 500 years .
We were three <unk> , and a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
( Laughter ) And then we have the right to say , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re not going to be the case .
We &apos;re just passports .
They &apos;re expected to write actual narratives that the writers with other millimeters .
A function is attributed to fiction .
They &apos;re not only the writers who are the ones that are the same , but they &apos;re the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that , but it &apos;s not about the fact that there is no hope .
All over the world .
I saw this in the first time in the year 2005 when I was in the middle of the year , and I saw that in 2005 , that I was going to be in the middle of the line .
I work with the fact that women are familiar with the same way that men and women are , in fact , a lot of the work that women are .
When the prophet were reported , the big little <unk> problem was around the world .
I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be talking about the <unk> of the <unk> , who I think is the one .
But I would like to just point out that there are two sides of the world .
It &apos;s just a story .
I don &apos;t want to spend time with the word &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; in the case of the &quot; &quot; tell . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be able to say that .
I think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not seeing how it &apos;s going to cope , and it &apos;s not just the way you see it .
They &apos;re familiar with the software , but the political books are so far , the political writers are not the language of politics , but the language of politics is not the language of politics .
It &apos;s the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; The <unk> and the <unk> &quot; &quot; is the whole idea of understanding the truth .
And the final thing is , &quot; &quot; The definition of politics . &quot; &quot; The political act of politics is a place .
One is that the ability to make it happen .
The answer is to do with the other .
One is the border .
The wind is defined as the sun .
The British is <unk> .
The social capital .
They had a <unk> story that said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , who &apos;s not going to be a good deal , &quot; &quot; and they would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not going to have a long time .
They changed the way that they could change the landscape , the different ones , the <unk> .
Everyone told him that he had to listen to him , people who were dressed , even flooding , Muslims , Hispanics .
&quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; Close borders . &quot; &quot; Middle South Asia , North Africa , Balkans and Asia adopted , like , &quot; &quot; Lession of what &apos;s being done . &quot;
Today , the stories are going to push the stories .
They &apos;re a <unk> , senior and Israel who spoke the Israeli policy of the book , but they were talking about the phenomenon of passionate writing , who was a passionate writer who had a great conversation with the face of the brave news .
And our skill , when we have a lot of it , is to make us more .
If you can do that , you don &apos;t have to do it well .
The book is called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a <unk> child .
But there &apos;s also a security of the book that &apos;s going to be used to make sure that the book is going to be the same .
And after the software and yesterday of the modern world , the first time the artist was going to be in the hospital , the first time the book was going to be in the air , the book was going to be the same as the <unk> of the book .
As the water says , we can &apos;t see , &quot; &quot; If you can &apos;t see the problem , we know that the problem is more subtle than ignorance , and not a lot of us . &quot; &quot; We know that the problem of communicating is not just a problem , but we don &apos;t know about it , and we don &apos;t see
There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like drawing compass .
One of the reasons it &apos;s got a stable is a constant .
On the other hand , the Arab one is dominating my unit .
Like that , my fiction as well .
The same part of the project I wrote was a common architecture that I wrote , and the more part of the world , the more of the world , the more <unk> it was .
I believe that this is a local , <unk> account , and it &apos;s a place where you can see it all the time , and it &apos;s all over there .
You &apos;re probably familiar with the fact that you &apos;ve probably stumbled across the tropics , and it &apos;s about 14,000 years from Olympic vents .
There &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a place called the Gulf of Finland , where there &apos;s a place called the Cins Management .
It &apos;s the place where the buildings are .
That &apos;s my argument .
We believe that there &apos;s a lot of hope that we can &apos;t believe what &apos;s happening .
We &apos;ve been looking at the evidence that the universe has been <unk> and <unk> about , which is the <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
And the idea is that the British has to be the same as the invention of the audience .
I &apos;m going to make a difference in the same way that I &apos;m going to be a writer .
I love to think about a 10 , which is 10 .
I love my wish to say that I love my own .
I can write a woman in a tradition of mine , and I can write a great happy woman , and I can tell you that there &apos;s a great little girl in the Norwegian row of my novel .
We can write about everything we can do .
&quot; Audo Lord said , &quot; &quot; Our dad says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry to say , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m free to say . &quot; &quot; And I think that was a
And I don &apos;t realize that we &apos;re not going to have to know that we &apos;re going to know the things that you know about the writers you know about the writers .
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for the beginning .
What we know is that we know who we are , and how we &apos;re connected to the information that we have .
We have to teach and teach ourselves to be a full part of our own .
We need to be gone from the <unk> , the other world .
And the way that they draw is the actual <unk> .
And they &apos;re not supposed to be the political condition , they &apos;re all made of a whole unified base .
I was going to end up with the water , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you can meet , &quot; &quot; and we can start to get the job , the things that are going to be like love ; love ; love , the World Earth .
( Applause )
My big sister is a little <unk> in the world , and it &apos;s a little bit like a little idea of the secret of our big Jupiter .
I &apos;m going to bed up to this little idea .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The lady &apos;s been called a group of women who have been a friend who &apos;s a <unk> .
They &apos;re women .
I was forced to learn how to value the product .
I &apos;d been able to tell you about two years ago , when I was a child .
I was struck by my head , my smile , my heart , and I was shot five of my left eye .
I started to understand the whole thing .
I was about to go to the point where I was in the study , I &apos;m not talking about , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say that , I &apos;m going to say that , in fact , the way that you &apos;re going to be , in fact , is that it &apos;s not more effective , because it &apos;s a normal bed .
( Applause ) So we &apos;re going to start this place , we &apos;re going to start with the ceremony .
The most important thing is we &apos;re going to be the most famous .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very clear that you can see the difference between the one and the other .
And as a kid , he was talking about a man who was singing , and he was about four hours before he had been sleeping .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I know that you can &apos;t , &quot; &quot; — &quot; You know , you know , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; I did . &quot;
What &apos;s more interesting if you have five hours of the time ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) People are more likely to spend a lot of time .
I &apos;m here to say , &quot; &quot; What is it that we &apos;re doing here ? &quot; &quot; And if you ask , &quot; &quot; What are eight ? &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s eight ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a little bit more like eight nights , but you know , you &apos;ve got a few places , and you &apos;re going to go through a few places , and you &apos;re going to have a few of the things that are going on , and you &apos;re going to have a conversation with a few other places , and they &apos;re not
You can &apos;t see the same thing with the printing press .
It &apos;s not that good , it &apos;s a good thing to do , it &apos;s not a good leader , it &apos;s a good leader .
And the months that we &apos;re talking about are the ones that are changing the way we do .
And he was the great <unk> of a big <unk> <unk> , and he was able to do the best of his friends .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> 7 , seven hours or eight hours of bed , or <unk> , and maybe four hours of <unk> , could be found .
And in fact , if we &apos;re a study that we &apos;ve been able to do , we &apos;re not going to be able to live in a way that we &apos;re not supposed to live , but we &apos;re not really excited to live in our lives , and the fact that we &apos;re not supposed to be the one that &apos;s been done for us , is the best of all .
I &apos;d like you to just see that you &apos;re looking for the great ideas in your pocket , your eyes , your eyes , your eyes , you &apos;re discovering the power of your dreams .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And I think that the brain is going to be the case for the brain .
What &apos;s the problem ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about Dr. <unk> , who is the only one who is not the only part of the planet .
&quot; &quot; What if you could have a conversation with people who were normal , who are normal ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not a kid .
I was in the same room with the fact that I was in my brain .
I was like , I &apos;m going to be blind enough .
If you see the brain , you can see that the brain is two of the two <unk> of a living .
And this is the part of the room , and it &apos;s a gift of the future .
So , the right example of this is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and we are able to make a difference .
He &apos;s been a <unk> , and he &apos;s been treated .
And it &apos;s a lot of different things that we can do , and it &apos;s just about making different things .
I &apos;m going to give you a minute . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
The right brain is actually learning how to do with the physical activity of our own .
The current point of the energy that &apos;s happening at the same time is how it looks about the current system of the entire senses , how it makes sense , how it makes , what it feels like , how it is , how it &apos;s made , how it is , how it is .
We &apos;re the ones that are the most active brain systems that we have in our brains .
This is the thing , the full , the right , the full .
So the left brain is a complete place , and it &apos;s a complete place to be .
We think we &apos;re going to be a scanning <unk> .
And he &apos;s taken away with the press , he &apos;s got his attention to the <unk> .
And if we think about the left , we think about the right brain .
It &apos;s a world of <unk> that we have in our world .
This is how we put together a picture of the sky .
I think that we should be doing this in the same way that we have to do it .
And I was in the process of doing it , and I started to work .
So , I &apos;m sorry to say that , you know , I &apos;m not sure — that I have been taken from the point of view of the creation of the truth .
And I think that &apos;s what you &apos;re moving to slow down .
And I think that the shower of the shower room is to go to the hospital .
I was the only one who was the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; to the <unk> .
I can &apos;t believe in the atoms and molecules in the Wall and the molecules .
The one thing I could know is that the energy — the power of energy — power .
What if I had seen it ?
I &apos;m all my colleagues , and I &apos;m not sure what it is to have a lot of work .
And I &apos;m sorry to say that the <unk> .
And what you &apos;re seeing is that you &apos;re just going to hit your eyes .
It was a vision .
And the left brain is the back of the brain .
And I &apos;m going to tell you about my right hand .
My brain is &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; !
( Laughter ) And then he would say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t have a lot of good . &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a good time . &quot;
We need to be a dog , I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m going to work on the workplace .
I &apos;ve been working on a <unk> .
And I went back to the point where I got a little bit of help , and I went back to the front of the room .
So I &apos;m going to take a bet from the <unk> , which is the <unk> I &apos;ve been <unk> .
I think I &apos;m a lot of you , &quot; I &apos;m like the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What I &apos;m going to do is my work is my life .
And my brain , I &apos;m a <unk> , is a <unk> between two and 13 .
How can we be a big <unk> , and how do you live ?
And I &apos;m just going to have a strong , strong , emotional , <unk> <unk> .
So , we have to choose the right brain .
