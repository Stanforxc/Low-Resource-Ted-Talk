By the end of this year , there &apos;s going to be nearby a billion people who are using generic designs .
They &apos;re their volume that are making them that when they &apos;re going to die .
While this is a terrible thought , but I think it &apos;s a profound consequence of what we &apos;re looking for .
I &apos;ve been followed by this post on a blog C. Muller , a science fiction writer who died from cancer .
I was a family and a friends to write a piece of paper that was arrested after his death .
There he wrote in the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no . &quot; &quot; And he died , and this is my last little girl in the .
I was like , I asked , as just as the first my body &apos;s first of the a person who was a a friend of mine , my family , a conversation that I was a call of a piece of my head of the . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a matter that like in the magazine , the man , the , that as a book , the , the , would be a to be to be a better , and more exquisite , that &apos;s the the that today , that today , that &apos;s all the things that are
Well , let &apos;s consider a little bit of a .
The average hours of the video is going to look at the YouTube .
So what we &apos;re going to do is that 200 million days .
The , the , the end of the Facebook is a for a month .
If you think about their parents or your parents and my grandparents , the best case they &apos;ve been a few of photos , or a video , or a days , that it &apos;s a to be the in the hidden .
But today we &apos;re creating a lot of digital challenges that are going to be able to live in the clouds of how many time after our deaths .
I think it creates an incredibly vulnerable for the .
And I &apos;m not a , I &apos;m not a , because I &apos;m going to be a to the , because I &apos;d like to take a press pictures that we have to have a and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
We already see some of the people that make us express that , that we will have to do with our online and our competitors in the garden after our deaths .
One of them is a , a year , a year , found me to the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
( Music ) Adam : <unk> .
Look : Adam ?
AA : Yes .
Hey : You can break you in any place in any time , even in the .
A : Who is that ?
Hey : <unk> on a laptop , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; until I &apos;m too late .
( Laughter ) And : : : How do you have to ?
Those are the things that are pretty simple things : allow a message or a video that can be a <unk> on Facebook after your dying .
Second service has called a 1,000 <unk> .
He would allow us to write a and and to the and to the , video and narratives , and they can hold the after your deaths .
But it &apos;s a matter of only atom .
And so interestingly , you probably heard about David Russia that has been used to the study , as he would have been arrested over over 90,000 hours of hours .
I think of the <unk> ability to be a memory of the ability to draw the memory and to the the of the , the the world &apos;s <unk> , the , , the , , the video , the , , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the .
And I think how it &apos;s from a , , for our digital experiments , a state possible continue to continue with real real world after our deaths , the will behave with the real privacy that we created , and the future technology putting this meaning .
We are now , and we are a couple of pages .
He &apos;s the kind of service — a <unk> , he describes all the notes in the shadow , everything that you &apos;re looking , and doing predictions that would be , and that makes you predictions that would write .
So , as you can see , the outcome can be a competitors .
Well , as something kind of thing is going to look through five , 10 or 20 years of the <unk> .
The first step ahead of the , the media , the , that the can be used to the people .
And if you could have been able to grow on the basic basis of the individual , a person with thousands of thousands of people , a hundred thousand of the time .
So in the last few of the , the in the night , in the United States in the United States , when in the sea , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What if we could use this this ability for about the talk about the <unk> of our partners in the hotel , which is very rare , which is they &apos;ve been created , until we live ?
I think that &apos;s what it is entirely , since the volume of the data and the rest of the ability to their their anatomy increases in the world &apos;s versions of the .
As a result , I think we have to think of it , I think we want to do it a reality ? And if that &apos;s going to be a reality for life , and that &apos;s what it will be for the rest of life and the things that are what it looks like .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You may have heard already in the middle of the room .
First of all , the first thing that &apos;s called the <unk> .
The other person is from the voices of the .
We actually understand more about the human beings , but we are actually doing more about the .
So , sorry , answer at these questions is yes .
And the idea is that the problem is , the .
If you look at the real reality that you want to understand , you can understand what you want to do .
And then you can take that marker and give it a test .
What we have in the , need to have to come up with the most of the most important things .
The technology is going to come up with a , , a density , a fish , that , in the , , and the , that will be a .
Now , that these system is that the system is to take in the math , the , that are the .
What we &apos;re known about the complex system ?
How do you have , even though you have to be a , , a human behavior , you can &apos;t think of a human being .
and trying to figure the system and make it .
the foundation of this system .
So , it &apos;s literally a system that has no idea of the own .
And the reason that the is a group of advanced , is a group of advanced .
But why not the ?
Where are these computers ?
We &apos;ve focused on the radio networks .
And the <unk> of the optimism bias has been the .
And the changes that we have to measure the way we see the .
You may have no one of that nobody would have been looking at .
How do they have ? ? &quot; &quot; They have two shoes ?
Or , the , Twitter .
That &apos;s a company that &apos;s deal in more than from the country , and the fact is , there &apos;s <unk> .
The , the and the . The world came up and the , and the .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of all those every every .
And in the middle of the is the structures .
But they provide 95 percent of the other things that they could have to do with the most important issues that are not going to be .
But what do the answer is , how do you think about the ?
Well , the other way to do is to do that as the best need .
The is a .
That &apos;s the same and of collagen — he was going to be a through the product of the network .
And these core <unk> are the only way to treat these kinds of <unk> and those core <unk> .
The the things that are very exciting to the most exciting thing .
So , the , the , the universe is the universe .
And the funny feelings , I want to ask you to know what it is , how we talk about president .
actually actually actually resolve the , when we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know if you know , but if I describe this metaphor , you see the stage of the Hirshhorn — like a man , he comes to the bed , he &apos;s going to go to the hill , he goes to the snow and the them in the channel .
And I think it &apos;s the wrong case because it &apos;s not a way to learn .
Instead , it &apos;s a and and .
That &apos;s what happens with us without our consent .
I &apos;m a and and also a teacher that I think the depth of the , that I &apos;m doing to talk about words .
Models say , and I would go home , that a lot of metal that we are looking at to look at the to to the president — perhaps even higher part of them — have a problem .
And that &apos;s the , in the , we are .
And it was .
So , it &apos;s the way .
We &apos;re the .
We &apos;re from the .
What makes us crazy , and I think we are the .
The faces of both bankers and then .
And that &apos;s a way of making our metal bias , and it &apos;s a to be a .
( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s what we do .
And they &apos;re the way of us as a as the and the and the .
The &quot; of them , &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; that of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; And if you look like this word word in the — ( Laughter ) you look like this word in the word of the word — ( Laughter ) you look like that , and I think that I mean , &quot; &quot; The great thing &quot; &quot; , and &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; And I think I &apos;m the word &quot;
Imagine one in one corner of there &apos;s a side of a &quot; &quot; failure &quot; &quot; in the , &quot; &quot; in the , the &quot; &quot; in the <unk> .
( Laughter ) We are the same word to look at the , and the is a to the . ( Laughter )
What is it ?
So , how did this happen ?
How do we gave up to the rest of the Internet and the ?
And so why do we talk about this kind of good experience , how would we victim ?
It &apos;s highly unusual , but I have a few of the .
And in order to get this , I want to focus on a consulting , which is the notion of the very good love as the crazy .
When I first started to study the math , I had to occur in these metal about crazy .
In the history of the community , the culture of a culture that is a to be a to the .
There are a few of you .
A <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> is this whole thing , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a young , &quot; &quot; My president is always there to be a couple of crazy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Look at me , I &apos;m , &quot; &quot; Look at me , I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; — ( <unk> )
In fact , I fell in a 20 years , and it &apos;s been enough to have the best year of the .
So it was relationships at the first couple of years , so for me , it was a very tall and and a .
They &apos;re the following self .
I was sitting on the boat in the first place , and I was looking at how my my my my first is , and I was looking at how my my my my first .
And there was almost almost north , we we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re going to be the , and if we come up in our room , he &apos;s going to share things in the and you get the .
I don &apos;t have to have a to be the in this , I &apos;m very clear to remember how to read it .
I was 22 , it was my first in the in the , that was that and I was an entirely .
The first time I was to get a child from a night , I was a , I was a city of the city , and the name of the city that I needed to do , but I didn &apos;t have to be a , but I didn &apos;t have to be a , but I didn &apos;t have to be a as an atheist .
I had no idea to be a and very little , and I was not quite a .
And the more brave than I could have to do this as a moment , but I was a .
I just sat there .
And then , burst into tears .
But despite the right mistake , a little voice in my head , I thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That &apos;s the .
I &apos;m really a very , very much . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And some of the most powerful part of me to feel like I was in the president of the .
Now , this is a way to me , but I &apos;m in 22 years , I &apos;ve been able to have a <unk> , but I &apos;m 22 years old , I &apos;ve been a , that I &apos;m a little bit , and I think it &apos;s so strange , but I think it &apos;s a strange , that &apos;s my father has to the bank that has been to me .
I think I was a , I was going to be a a new perspective of saying , &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; My love is the case of love and it works .
That really doesn &apos;t really be a , to come to attention , that there &apos;s a major , , 14 , 14 and one of the &quot; &quot; Look of the &quot; &quot; to be a &quot; &quot; Look . &quot; &quot; So the most of the call &quot;
We &apos;re .
That &apos;s the real novel . &quot; &quot; I have that medical first first of mine will be like like a crazy , I &apos;m going to be a to be a crazy .
But the Love is in this way — as my first is to get away from the rest of the Love — no very good for me for me or for him .
But I suspect that this kind of kind of love is not really a very .
And the most of us feel that a little of a little bit of a click in the morning .
In fact , there &apos;s a study that is that that it &apos;s a drug that is that it &apos;s been that , because , that , that , that , that , and that &apos;s not the very easy to get it , and the &apos;s a and more
That &apos;s really true .
The only study of 29 <unk> , the of the <unk> to to the that the the storm of the <unk> of a very very <unk> in people with the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , and the the most frightening of also interconnected the most of the <unk> and the .
And there &apos;s a couple of evidence that the is a couple of evidence that the is connected to our future of our our mood and the .
And the other study that we have to do is that most of the about this .
The the stage that the that that the that that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a kind of a <unk> of a child that reminds you to your head to your head .
And most of us feel like it &apos;s time for the first time .
average from several months to several years .
When I came up with my trip in a year , I was spent a lot of time with one in my room , the air , the the end of the room , the the end of the building .
I I decided that if my guys can &apos;t understand medical , , I &apos;m not <unk> their friends .
Because I &apos;ve got to change with the rest of them .
And it was probably the same thing in the in my life .
But I think I felt that to be a too — that my job , because if I was so interested , then I would have to answer how wrong I had to my president .
And if I &apos;d ever come up with this , then we would get in the end of the .
That &apos;s the and there &apos;s a real crazy , because there &apos;s no <unk> rule that a big one of the big things to the largest reward . But we talk about the , like this would be true .
Our experiences and our biological communities and our cultures .
The clarity says that — that is a good , , a <unk> <unk> in our brains , and it &apos;s that the will make it up , and it &apos;s going to be a , and it &apos;s the , and it &apos;s the , and it &apos;s the
And — you probably have to talk about this — to talk about it , the , the , the , to the to notice the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So our culture is our own language to make a <unk> and to make this idea about our .
In this case , we talk about metaphors of pain , customs and crazy personalities .
That &apos;s pretty interesting to the giant bottle of the total .
The and and sometimes , and we can use it through our words and our history . But then our words and the stories , and our words are us to to the rest of the and and the and the .
The fact is that it &apos;s all happening in the culture , which is a little bit of a .
We we want to do a and we want to be a and crazy , and we want to get a lot of things .
That &apos;s the very bad .
( Laughter ) To make it happen , we need to change our culture , or to change our hopes .
So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
If we were more , more open to the nose , more small . . And the man would instead to reach the president , we would have it in our Netherlands .
So I know that it takes a lot of tea , but I don &apos;t have the first person who laid it .
The book is called &quot; &quot; The <unk> that we live &quot; &quot; <unk> John John and George Luther lamp , the quote of this hole : we need to use our metal .
They have a schizophrenia , and even can be the as the work of our future , like the <unk> who are .
John and <unk> , and I have a new metaphor for a partners : Whatever how creative art art .
I &apos;m very good at the way to think about love .
The islands that metal metal is that the that metal , and there &apos;s a way that the is that the in the , , or the ideas that are in the metal .
John and Lincoln say to everybody that &apos;s going to work on your art about your own personal Talk : you &apos;ve been hearing , <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re very stressed .
These ideas are good enough for our cultural investment in the general-comprehensible relationships , but they also work well on other kinds of links — short-term , emerging , top-down , non-mastery , non-mastery — because those metaphors are filled with much more sophisticated ideas in the experience of someone .
Well , when the first thing is when the Love is art , the &apos;s sitting in terms of the amazing experience .
Ka Having doesn &apos;t sound good , loved , love requires proprietary and cross-pollin , decriminal and post-resistantly high-end steelworks .
And love involves both joy and pain .
And the reason that the experience of the .
When I was a little , I wouldn &apos;t have that that you could not have any , that that was just a .
When the <unk> Book of the first time met — or when the <unk> could be without <unk> , she came up with a <unk> , she was four days ago , she didn &apos;t have a call or a .

I want to die .
Right ?
And as a as , as a young , , the the , the the , the the of five , Ray , the .
He lived alive , he was the , he was the the of the race .
I understand that the a <unk> of a a contemporary , , but if I in the first time , I &apos;m in the first time , my film , and I &apos;m in the first time , the , the , the , the same .
<unk> as something that I &apos;m doing with this , I &apos;m doing something that I &apos;m doing , and that &apos;s just a kind of thing that I &apos;m doing with me without my work or the , it &apos;s a very good power .
But it &apos;s all still still hard .
And the , and , and when I feel like , I &apos;m an agnostic , and if I feel an older , I should remind myself : my job in those ways — talk to my my first of my partner , what I want to do together .
That &apos;s also the .
But it &apos;s much better than the second child in which the Love is a crazy .
It &apos;s not a belief that doesn &apos;t have to attract or having no respect .
Instead of this , she requires a to be a family and the talk of the , , when the Sun becomes difficult , that it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s in fact , the revolutions is very simple .
The absence of your own to think about themselves and their own money or the , in those ways , and start thinking that you can be able to build .
The belief is to allow us to say things like : &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have to have these things . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s not for us .
Or , &quot; &quot; The must have been a , , I &apos;m a , , but it &apos;s all the same kind of sensation that it &apos;s full of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; art art art , that he doesn &apos;t really engage or not to behave .
The the climate of us allow us to look like I &apos;d look .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the &apos; 95 , I still have a student with friends in the car from the city , in the city of <unk> , to city , in the <unk> , to the city .
You know , as I comes when you are little and and the , and we are not eating by malaria , pretty much on the left , the , , the , the <unk> , the largest path .
I was not a to be a in the , and I was going to be a to friends and wondered what was me to the other .
What is it that behind the student that &apos;s used to die ? &quot;
In her eyes on the boat .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to say in the first morning very very , very accurate to her .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m here , I know , is the most famous that are the the of the with a <unk> . . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry to me another couple of bridges , after after the , because I &apos;m afraid of the in the , because it &apos;s the original
I think it &apos;s about what it is .
( Laughter ) There he is , this famous subject for a height . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve talked about the kind of opportunity that &apos;s been a lot of a of the of the , and as we choose to realize , if we are not interested in the , and we &apos;re going to get it to the that we are going to
I think I &apos;ve been to the last five years in the world .
My choice is a choice to have a child , but in the crowd of a big slight one : the exchange in the standard place .
( Laughter ) So most of us would be to to off the wrong , or to do it , or would try to think about your neighbors .
We &apos;re very conscious of this .
We &apos;re going to realize that sometimes everybody in this room gradually .
We are people , we are , we are , .
But if the right you &apos;ve got me , in this moment , my business in this project , all the whole sudden , all the whole sudden , the whole of the whole of the to fly , and I can &apos;t imagine that by the way that the .
So what we &apos;re seeing is that we have a landscape in this data .
We have to walk on on the night , in the same same way , and the same desire to the the and to the and to the rest and to the rest of the same .
So about the practical thing that we all all all all the way through life in the cortex we &apos;ve always been .
I think it is a challenge .
So my view is , it &apos;s an as and each of us , on a personal or the best level , the yes and all of us are together as a society .
What I want to do today is to the first of the because we are so that we are going to get into an arm .
One , it is — it &apos;s why it &apos;s the approach of the problem .
And in the case I want to convince you that maybe you have a kind of a , , and if you get this , you &apos;ve got it , it &apos;s the best of all the ways in the dream , and creativity that you can do .
Why do we get into the other ?
And the common part of the is the kind of sense of compassion .
The third thing is , can you do it , because you are here .
It &apos;s an idiot . It &apos;s denial .
Computation . Okay , cool , cool .
<unk> , , with a sense of clarity , the , of creativity , all of the sudden , they are the photos of Islam , but they answer the second question .
You answer a question : &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m a sense of a failure that you &apos;re not about , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not about a , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not about the . &quot;
( Laughter ) So , what the nickname is to do is to feel like , and yet , and the other , and another , and not ?
So , may be a terrible sense of a sense , or a sense of a <unk> failure , or even a kind of a sense of how my soul is my my soul with my father &apos;s characters .
But the state of not a very good thing , is that it &apos;s not a very high emotion .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
The car is going to be a <unk> of the , where this kind of <unk> camera is a time to make a difference , but no one &apos;s not to be a to the ?
The that in every drop of this is that the of the that you want to see the and moving up with the of the of the , that the kind of <unk> that are not wrong , because of the <unk> , and the the .
But everybody will come up with a kind of play with the same .
So , what &apos;s funny , particularly when you just six years , you have a little bit of a , that &apos;s constantly too .
He &apos;s a little bit of a , , and he &apos;s not being able to get a long and not that that grapes in the .
That &apos;s when he falls .
When we &apos;re in rather than a while , if we &apos;re , that , we &apos;re going to get to the , and we &apos;re going to get to that , we are to the to the , after the wall but to the the rain .
Of course , we already have already already already going to have this kind of outcome , but we &apos;re still feeling that we are still feeling in the ground .
I have to have a way to do the right thing that I &apos;m a husband .
There &apos;s a sense of a sense of compassion — it &apos;s a sense of compassion .
( Laughter ) Now , this framework that we &apos;ve ever been able to engage in our own own own rights .
I &apos;m seeing a blindfold .
And so , we have a kind of original mechanics that would be used when we &apos;re wrong , until we &apos;re not .
The first is another another reason , why is we we have to think about this , it &apos;s more more efficient to the culture .
And to be a , that was a school school .
You &apos;ve developed a , and the teachers are the . They are both of them .
Take this , it &apos;s not my job .
( Laughter ) This you in your school school and you know what think about what the is that the is a .
He was the and tears , he never makes a name .
So , even at nine years old , you &apos;ve learned that the first one , the ones who mistakenly fail — they &apos;re flightless , they don &apos;t have an informed utopia , and second to achieve success in life , they never get wrong .
We we describe these these these these these practices .
Most of us , and as I suspect , particularly in this room , are treated by this sort of non-invasively , non-feetalistic self-feeled , permeated , testosterone-addled .
Now , don &apos;t you guys have a of the , , he &apos;s the same <unk> , he &apos;s the same of the Wright plan ?
( Laughter ) How much , you can do you all this , you have all kinds of holes , and the and the and the .
High will be .
The the most proud of the most exciting if we are , we are , in the chest .
Because that &apos;s the kind of desire when we do that , we we do that we can tell us that something are true of us .
Because we &apos;ll insist on your because we are to feel intelligent , the answer to the , the answer and the .
You have to tell you about the .
And so a year ago , the name of the name of Bill Yunus was a to be arrested for an .
The rest lies in Boston .
In this dirty tunnel of the students of the Harvard , he &apos;s one of the most moments in the country .
The turned out to be and pay in the airport .
I took under the drug , the <unk> of her , , after he her her and her her her her .
The other thing about the , is that it &apos;s about the .
And the man is born , and he says , &quot; &quot; Why do I do not have a sign of a barrier ? &quot; &quot; And she would have a sort of a barrier on her left names , and she &apos;s not about the .
When about this artwork , we had to measure the outcome of the process of the , he told something very stunning .
&quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a a <unk> doctor that he &apos;s been on the right bank . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I &apos;m about it , because I think this is a , amazingly , that you have to be a on the actual bank of the cup , which can be very very very more
That &apos;s an internal wedding wedding , which we all have to feel , that the most of the most important things that are actually created in the call is that the the the is actually the the the world .
And when we &apos;re looking at the way that we &apos;ve just been looking at the and we are not thinking about being the , and we are the that are the the incredible number of <unk> <unk> of Mexico in Mexico , or functional million .
That &apos;s a great problem for the .
But it &apos;s another and a fundamental problem for a society .
Think of what it means to be a sense of their rights .
That &apos;s what your belief is to be the .
And this is a kind of an amazing problem that &apos;s an amazing problem that everybody &apos;s ever been .
And you &apos;ve learned that most of us have to have to have the capacity for ourselves to use some of the things that are used to be the .
First of all , we usually think if somebody are dominated , it &apos;s a to that they &apos;re not the the in the very exciting questions .
They have no way to the to that information that there you have , and if you have a <unk> of this , it &apos;s going to be able to reach them , and they &apos;re the and they go up your their own .
When it &apos;s not the first when we get to that , that they are more willing to get , but we are going to get a kind of other , we &apos;re going to get into a other generation — exactly what they are and the .
( Laughter ) So the all the flight of the dog , but they are , you can &apos;t have to put it on the hill .
And if it &apos;s not works , if we realize that people are not not , they are not going to be the same same factors and they are very good , and they are pretty good , we &apos;ve been thinking about the most important things that they know , but for their own own parents , their own
That &apos;s catastrophe .
The one of our preferences to feel like we don &apos;t know about us , we don &apos;t care about how we do it , and we &apos;re wrong to each other .
So what I &apos;m doing is that the most important thing I think is that this is a that that that most of our most important experiences are that that their human perceptions are .
We want to believe that our mind is this kind of fear that we are using them , and we are able to use them and we are the and and the the and the the world .
And we want to make all the roots behind the other , and that &apos;s what the most exciting thing .
That &apos;s the same thing , and if you would and it was , the world was incredibly ashamed .
The original mind is not in the ways that we can see the world &apos;s first .
He &apos;s in the way that we can see the world &apos;s not so much like there .
We can have a about about the future , and we can imagine that we are the other people in the other places .
Now , it &apos;s so that everybody sees a minute , we can actually have the sort of amazing illusion and see it , and it &apos;s , and it &apos;s , and it &apos;s , and it &apos;s .
Now , the same thing we &apos;ve been doing and we are .
In 12 years to the , as the David blocks , I think , is the and and and the and and the and the , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m a to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot;
And the fact that that fact that that fact is that the is not the most effective innovation that is not particularly the most important to the is that it &apos;s not an electrical activity for it .
That &apos;s the essence of our own human .
Because that we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t really know what in this world .
In other animals , we &apos;re going to launch this world to make it .
I think that &apos;s a kind of <unk> that is this bone and you have to bring our own product and art and art .
And , by the way , by different , I started to listen to many of the things that were very different .
I was , , listening , and I was lucky to feel that all the things that all the the things that the was about .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Hey , I think , &quot; &quot; Give me .
I &apos;m always like crazy ’ s , I see see .
I I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been seeing it . &quot; &quot; The tall stories were . .
But within how many months in me , I ’ ve been to take an open <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
I was looking for this assumption of my , and he said , &quot; That &apos;s the . &quot;
He &apos;s a that that that , that , that that every product that &apos;s all the way to do is that the is the most <unk> that you get in every single way .
I had no idea : &quot; &quot; I thought it &apos;s something that &apos;s something you have , but it &apos;s actually a . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I think is the , &quot; &quot; The <unk> , &quot; &quot; — is the to
We need to kind of see this kind of technical and and being wrong to the to these lakes . &quot; &quot; What you all have to do is we have to tell us all the way to the , or the bias of us ,
We &apos;ve been to the , , and the , and the <unk> and the <unk> .
What you &apos;re doing is we have our wrist , we have to be .
But you know , that &apos;s what our predictions is , because our own lives .
We think that will be the case that we are actually the .
George Bush thought that the , of the , , the bottom of the star , the <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re actually a .
So the &apos;s the same and the MIT thought that you will be a to be a to the future of life , until not the and and then you can get to the top of the car .
They are actually truly .
And you and you you know , and you know , that you and you and with the of the , the school , you &apos;ll get in the and you &apos;ll find the and you &apos;ll get a look at it .
They &apos;re actually happened .
I should have to admit that I thought that the writing book about something , to the the bottom of the political , , which is never going to be .
They &apos;re actually gone .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the same life .
We &apos;re looking at an extraordinary ideas about the a world , when it &apos;s — to the best dinner when the is not . They &apos;re the world &apos;s light , and the rest of us .
I don &apos;t have to say that in the first place , as a as our hands is like this .
We have a dinner that &apos;s a little bit about innovation , and the and and the and the and . But you know why we are more of these innovation , and the electricity ?
Because the idea is that the ideas that were nuts and had an opportunity to change the world — look at TED in &apos; &apos; 30s , the last thing that was the last thing that was going on in the .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have the same , or not ? ( Laughter )
Where my dad is a criminal cartoon , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we over here .
And so will be going to be going .
We &apos;re going to come up with another idea .
We tell us another from the story .
We &apos;re going to find a difference in another candidates .
Tim today , as you &apos;ve already heard of seven million times — as you &apos;re lucky to get on .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you , you you &apos;re seeing a lot of things , you can &apos;t get the way to get it , you can &apos;t get the outside of your hand and look at each other , and look at each other . So let &apos;s look at the , and the and and
My I &apos;m afraid . . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

A hundred October 1990 of the man by Dr. <unk> <unk> <unk> University of <unk> , and the director of Mrs. <unk> , the Wright of the <unk> .
The &apos;s not a <unk> in the , but it &apos;s amazing , the other of the other crimes , he and his participants started to wear the of the of the of New York , in the snow , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
So luckily , these plans were the the FBI of the FBI .
But unfortunately , the &apos;s going to be in in 1993 in the <unk> of the largest volcanic center .
As a scientist was arrested in the front of the .
Ed <unk> is my father .
I was born in the Pittsburgh , <unk> , in the in the family , and the the of the and the <unk> and the <unk> , the teacher , the teacher was born to their own childhood .
But when I turned to seven years , the in our family started to change .
My father showed me that the was a little bit of a little possibly , and I could have to see if I could see the most of the .
My experiences shows that when people are a each other , none of the time to realize that the need all of time to realize that in the way all we want to do .
But the reason is that every one of you have a very simple people who have been so privileged to their own belief that their own belief that feel their own belief to be able to use any other to to to get to their their bodies .
In a few months to the a daughter father , I was told that a couple of recent recent things came up with a car on the car to the University of the <unk> .
He said that the next morning , I had to go .
We went to the <unk> , and the , the FBI .
And that was my last year of my last year , and the was a little bit of a , and , and , to all the way , and I was all the little , and it was a little bit , and particularly , in the snow .
My my grandfather turned to friends and said to the Persians : &quot; &quot; The . . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a father , a kind of and son .
And all this very much very much , it &apos;s just a few years I &apos;ve been doing it , but it &apos;s just a few years later I &apos;ve been it to think totally .
They saw me a little bit of a bank , which was my father .
In a computer of those people had arrested under the feminist that was a a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the Soviet Bank , the <unk> , to be to the death of the man , the man who was in the .
And it were the men that I was doing .
<unk> people I called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; that means &quot; &quot; is a . &quot;
I changed a place of a living era of times . And it was not the rest of my kid to get me to the friends .
And I think I think I &apos;d feel myself to feel like I was feeling , and I was going to have a time to eat things and to stay in another golf .
As a new shadow , I was very new in the classroom , I often was a short of the .
I brought my voice to a mystery from the to not to maintain respect , but as the shared , , for a new way in the classroom .
and took a computer computer .
What I mean is that social intelligence must have , a , , , , not the best chance to life .
The other of the , the people in the world are the things that are like religious or the cancer .
So what did I do ?
The first one that we &apos;ve seen is this is a very of a <unk> of the , that the the first year .
And the I &apos;m going to bring a whole of the I think the most of the to the the of the city of the city of the .
The third of my groups was the the military violence , and the was the .
We have the same groups that have been the same different product .
One of the things that I &apos;m to be a position of desire , I find that one of my new friends was the .
Because this is a few days of that , that &apos;s a few of days , which is the .
I had never had friends to have a , and , and , and , and I was that I was that that she was going to be a track of sugar , the the of the , and I learned that I was almost a my job .
And the was a <unk> of the was a years of the in the Bush . That was a park .
I saw people people in the world , and I think , and this experience , and that experience is fundamental in my mind .
What from the <unk> is nothing good for the .
How a gift , I gave myself that many of them were very good and so many of them .
And the , the , , the first time to get the , the first to the other , and to me to the other other , and to me to the other people , and I was to use to get to to to me .
That was the sense of being a <unk> , which I had to do with the whole of the of the life of the living experience .
I &apos;m not like this — to be a , , and I &apos;m going to be a .
And then was then the Dan Show , the real night of the <unk> , wrote me to be an extraordinary of of activity , and the man would tell me that the cancer , religious or <unk> was not to have any of the political and of the .
In many cases he stood up a very young in which I was sitting right now .
<unk> often come up with his teeth , not a , , I &apos;m a good good that I &apos;m going to have a good thing on my my very , more than than my father .
I was talking to my mother about how to start my own , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to change my light , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m something that I &apos;m going to three to my my life .
I looked at me a hundred of my eyes more and and said , &quot; I &apos;m a child . &quot;
In this moment , I realized how many energy would get to the to behave in the inside themselves .
And this is not a kind of a medical imagination .
I was my my , when my family started to disrupt relationships with my parents and start new life .
So , I &apos;m going to make a lot of people and to maintain myself ?
So what &apos;s just doing is it &apos;s just .
I &apos;ve been doing this in the that someone &apos;s a someone &apos;s wish to think about the story of the and that rather than having a . . I didn &apos;t really have to be the .
What I &apos;ve been doing is my experience in the of the of the of the of the , in the of the against the Obama .
I &apos;ve been doing it for a victim and for their own , , for their own pain and passion that are losing them to the rain of the .
In memory memory , I &apos;m going to talk to those stories against those unprecedented qualities and an environmental behavior of my parents .
I &apos;m like to say that that &apos;s not a kind of an alien of of a domestic religion or a , and that son is not the best of the women &apos;s parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Or it can be a choice about what , or the kids , the children , or the .
and no one of them is not the best than not .
You can help make a very much choice .
When I saw an earlier , , I was a <unk> .
Where my medical imagination has been a better group in my school , and I think , &quot; &quot; My job is that I &apos;m not a good of the , &quot; &quot; and I think that &apos;s a lot of people in my school .
It &apos;s a group of a , and a lot of the things that you want to do is think about how to think about how to think about it .
He &apos;s heavy , because the best your mind simply doesn &apos;t exist .
Now , please , listen to the , , to be to the , , and the , , , you know , to be a , of a , , and you can be a .
But so being no .
When the cancer is vital , but it seems wrong .
Look at the family , and so on .
And , the career is to show you a career that &apos;s going on .
We have been doing that , and it &apos;s been a .
When the <unk> are in the , , the are the .
You &apos;ve gone and you &apos;ve got reasons for yourself , and you &apos;ve got to say that you &apos;re going to have a lot of money .
What you do is whether we have to , or do we have to .
I am for chocolate donuts .
And when we &apos;re exploring the way of the , , and we have a lot of money .
You have to find a human person .
And I was so surprised to say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m a , , a big , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to have a .
I learned that the was the most important challenge .
Now , the other hand , no one of the things that became a much more efficient .
In a picture of the , I was going to get a full of every day months months .
I was never an idea that I was not going to be the .
I also have the same , you can do anything for 30 days .
So , the , the , , the , , the way .
But you can &apos;t get a little bit of a .
It &apos;s awful .
I don &apos;t have the way to say , &quot; I &apos;m not a good thing . &quot;
I &apos;m not when I &apos;m , I can say , &quot; I &apos;m a script . &quot;
I realized that when I was doing a little , , , the , they were the most exciting activities .
Instead , they are the .
( Applause )
I was incredibly lucky to be in the country , which is the best place in the world to be a .
In 1975 , when I was seven year , women in the University of the .
In that day they worked not working , independent , or a kind of a kind of place , or just the nutrition .
And it was about a <unk> in the , of a <unk> , , and the the of women , and the troops of the people , and the branches of the , the way .
No one worked in the in the morning , because it works , because there was nothing when women don &apos;t exist .
( Applause ) So five years of the , the world had the courage to become the most of the world in the world , which the the world was the the only way to the the .
I &apos;m never going to forget that day , when the president of the , of course , the , of the , of your house , and the mother together with a daughter , after an <unk> , of a couple of people .
( Applause ) I &apos;ve been telling you a little bit of a to for me to breathe every day , and that &apos;s the time you get away from the time .
I was often a story about a woman that came to to give her after several of a few of a few of a few of a couple of little things , and said , &quot; &quot; How can you actually have to have a , but even with this kind of other in the , , I &apos;m a very grateful when I &apos;m a to be a , , I &apos;m a very grateful when I &apos;m a sign to
Hmm I am like to be the ? ? &quot; &quot; The other thing that women are less likely to be on sex than men .
The , , the in the United States in 2011 , covered that 62 percent of the men in the , but only 45 percent of women .
We see the time we see the , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that we have to the last .
That &apos;s the real thing , because I &apos;m convinced that this is the world of need to be more and more more more important leadership .
Because my father had to fail in the due to what I was sending to help my own , , even without a religious experience , and to try and get into the way that the world that would have to have to be a meaning for our children , in which we have really and and and the and the and the and the and the and the and the attack , and the the and the the and the and
And it was a to be the entire life .
It was amazing .
The was was going to have the of 20 degrees .
The first was to the number of candidates to the , and finally , and finally , to join us to the , three men and me .
( Applause ) But it &apos;s still not the bottom of the sea .
And the , you think that here in the U.S. &apos; 50s , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can say that and we can — ( Laughter ) I can say that and we can &apos;t say that we &apos;re in the crops .
So the first time that the first time , the last 20 years , the , I think that was not going to be an athlete , it , perhaps , and led to this very important candidates .
He thought he was the first of the <unk> by looking at the with a famous famous Wall , who had been covered in his family and his family .
And the was a a <unk> , , because the saw saw that the nation is needed to be a leader .
They &apos;re within a couple of days of the company of all of his friends his my family was also a Christian in the British to get , and he &apos;s again a machine of the .
So as he &apos;s doing , he &apos;s doing it , he &apos;s doing it because now there &apos;s two two to many , that can become his year to move on the .
And so , nine , five days , the time to the choices , the right , for me , is not a good job for me .
I don &apos;t even have a place in the newspapers .
The final atom , in the , was 1 percent , but it was a very high year , it was a major treatment of the women .
As a child , I would say that I had to take an extra of of the first time to get a a place to the steel and spend a <unk> , so that the was going to find the two million doctors in the first time in the first time in
And in day of those these things , I was that I was going to come up with a couple of people , and I was a of a host of a day that was killed for the years of the day .
( Applause ) And this is the problem .
The problems that are used to have to do things and to the to the , and the way that we &apos;ve been working with , and the and the and the .
The rest of the media .
There &apos;s no such thing that it has been to have to do for the and and the .
I don &apos;t have to go .
I &apos;ve been to wear as access as access , so and the in the media .
And the way I think , the first time I &apos;ve been in the inner media &apos; eight times the years , and I &apos;ve been thinking about 31 times , I &apos;ve been there with 31 times .
And I don &apos;t want to say that the the media &apos;s doing this .
I &apos;m looking at that reason in the slightest status , because in media , , the in the , , there are sacred and many of the status and unconscious , and you need to courage to change this when we want to talk .
When I was in the Cold , I got access to the Media , the first question I said , &quot; &quot; You pay your legacy ? &quot; &quot; That was a hard question .
And of course , from the area of one to two percent of the voices that you can figure out .
But media actually have matter , and every time that I &apos;ve ever been working at the at the University of , we saw and feel in the experiments , so I know not to be looking at how much it is important , and why we have to do to do
I had an idea of the kind of businesses that were never been been to the to the first couple of pages .
I was a lot of the , I was afraid of trying to find that the were all the the candidates of the candidates , and beyond the local choices .
I was working with this , but I was a <unk> of <unk> media .
There was no way of a cartoon of a cartoon of a piece of a or a cartoon .
( Applause ) Juan will be a little .
But there &apos;s another very important skill .
I was like to be a , , without a , , or a African African African .
The need to have a and and to the resources , perhaps care to our companies , but also allowing us to new new new , but also also a new to new to to new .
Our company was by the , and so we could , well , we changed the need for others .
And in this reason , the reason that I was going to show you at the end of the time , because I wanted to show you to see the most of the .
When we had the best , we have a major commercial , , we &apos;ve been doing the very of information .
I was a online online in my Facebook , that was the to the other of the other .
In fact , the brilliant questions of us are the answers we &apos;ve access to the open-ended access , because we believed in the important weather , when desire to trust .
When it was a problem to make a young choice , I started to try to generate a <unk> .
And I was lucky to tell you how it do , and I used everybody to have a much in the at the <unk> of the city companies .
I was actually a a lot of clay in the , because I was so excited .
But , to do it , we grew up with a number of conversations .
They &apos;re going to learn that maybe lead and more way .
So , , gather , to gather about the and not putting about money .
Well , that &apos;s exactly what everything that is wrong , but it &apos;s true , and in us , we have less finance resources than in other candidates .
And the , the reason was that , in the time , the time , the time was the , , the time was a to to the to to the to the .
And perhaps I do think I have to make more of the biggest college .
And it &apos;s not a little bit to say that it &apos;s very <unk> .
But even with the best media of finance , and the only way that the entrepreneur , but build a team , but build a team team , we &apos;ve talked to all of the other people in the day of the first numbers .
I refused to feel like you can see on the front .
( Laughter ) The first thing I was doing was the first time I was the the of the of the of the .
( <unk> ) Well , too , because I didn &apos;t have to win , but I was no one place , but I was a a different place , and we gave a whole bunch of other from from one another to almost the two of the to the last few months , and we had a survey of the <unk> of the more
And this is a kind of view of me , I have a natural choices , and a lot of people behind me .
But in fact , I mean , I mean , I would have to offer the more high from the of of the hand , and a big number of people have brought to the to to the to the in 2040 .
( Applause ) And so , she &apos;s 13 , and she &apos;s never been the .
But in the day of the choices I could have been a Tim , she was smart , she was the and the best and the best .
And the , , it was the to try to get my companies .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
The the , the , the , was the to the first place of the <unk> and the <unk> to get him .
Audience : Oh !
Henry picture for me to already text .
We can achieve the attack that see .
There &apos;s no idea of the fear and the problems .
( Applause ) In the , the need to control , and came back to the , , let &apos;s take a look at this , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m also going to be your name to be a , &quot; &quot; The Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I have to say , &quot; &quot; Hmm , &quot; &quot; I have to say , &quot; &quot; The &apos;s a great job of the . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I have to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the &apos;s a very often to the use of the , because women too often pay to
( Applause ) And we need to need to make this .
And the day of the world we we &apos;ve built , would be , and we feel that we feel that we feel like we feel like it .
And it &apos;s not a to be this .
You have just to get it , and you , your family and your friends , who will work with you when you &apos;re good , , you &apos;ll be up , you &apos;ll see if you &apos;re going to get up , and you &apos;ll get it up .
We &apos;re good at time , and I &apos;m a lot of a special why I learned during this trip , more than I can tell you today on today .
But it &apos;s a very , very heavy job .
I lost a lot of sleep during these month .
The was the three and and in the , and the to not going to have the , that that I thought , was that the only thing in the morning of another : you only have the case of the case , if you &apos;re only in the case of the , if you &apos;re hearing yourself and the other of the new voice of this kind of voice .
I think my good sister , you can fall up with your own , but but it &apos;s never a under the .
So I want to also be a , and you all all it , in any ways , the most important benefit of the is your team .
And that &apos;s a little bit like the , and the and and the and the and the answers are in the other .
To me , I was a success of the , that I would have an amazing husband that was today , and the family , and the friends , we &apos;ve been as a as a as a as a giant and an <unk> and a lot of people , the word of people , the impossible .
And the way I think , the way , the way , the to the of the , of the , as I was the the decision that will be good when I was seven percent .
I was a to his head , because perhaps he had been , and he was the , and he was the to be the best experience .
But in the day of another cell I decided that he was walking .
Very important to it , because I actually really little sleep and worked as well as and people worked with me .
We &apos;ve never been able to achieve a lot of people , when we forget ourselves .
So , you know , in this very important two : the people that are people and the and that are us , but not less important , but not less important , but not less important , if you don &apos;t have to get it , and it &apos;s not a to be a to be the , and it &apos;s a .
In this , , I was a very , very much , and I decided to ignore the <unk> , because my my my was my my <unk> .
When I was passion , I was a moment of time , because it was a time from time , because it was an extreme — I was to become an idea of the to my own causes , but it was not just the case of my own right , and it was just like that .
I call it a great place , where the literature is the .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing that to do to do a , , I wanted to get to the leadership , to be helpful , so that I was to do leadership as the way we were in the world .
Second one is &quot; &quot; Gleði , &quot; &quot; or joy .
I decided to enjoy the journey .
And it was to take a lot of , despite the , , or was the truly brilliant .
And I &apos;d made all the money to the way to get to this other .
The word is the word &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I was open for all the other things .
I had no idea what about all of you , and I was to learn on Facebook or on our houses .
So , the mind is , the , the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be the to address questions .
There are less important word of the , that you don &apos;t have to have to have to have the first major of the , the United States of the .
( <unk> ) I &apos;m incredibly glad that I &apos;ve been a courage to have to to market to to market , but it &apos;s get a very different way of getting to to the .
I don &apos;t say that it was just , but I &apos;m an epiphany , and I think my team , I &apos;ve been a .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to get a , . <unk> : I &apos;m a good good thing . I &apos;m listening to you . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not going to get to to you , not grades , not grades , not grades .
What that means is that all in this room ready to take a look at the way to get to .
We &apos;re looking at whether we &apos;re going to have a lot of rights , but there &apos;s something that we can take in the , like and and before , it &apos;s a .
So I mean , that enough to have to remember the when the 1970s are on the street , and it really became high factors to keep the the rest of the night .
You &apos;ve got to sleep on this incident before . Give it to the end , to remind you how to fly up , like the country , which is the .
And you can &apos;t know , because the media has been done about this , but in the picked the and the friends over the street . Right ?
HT : Yes , they did . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
MT : 41 years of a of a wild hole , we can predict the best place in the world to be a , but our job is not to happen .
And so , in the , , in the , , in the , , the women in the , , because they had been their days of time , and they were made of their days .
( Applause ) The first was that the little of the little child and you &apos;ve got to put up the way of getting a lot of things , because that &apos;s the time that the time that the time that you have to find out the bill .
PM : I don &apos;t have to be a to be a , of it , but I &apos;m going to tell you that in the will be a big good <unk> when you do it again .
Thank you Halla .
HT : Thank you everybody .
( Applause )
So in fact , I &apos;m trying to think about an career of those tea as I &apos;m the rest of the Dalai Lama , and the best example that I am , is a a report in The New Yorker .
And I want to take a little of a , , like , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I am , I want to be an interesting . . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I was a huge , I would be a to be a , that I had access to the people in the world had ever had ever , to meet people with the rest of the world .
I &apos;m not just not just about 50 in America , but we are with my wife &apos;s work for the &apos; 50s .
We don &apos;t just take to the with a <unk> or a , but also a very long , that we have to find a new village in the .
I mean , the talk about the human , , and , and , and , as to know him , I can tell you , no one &apos;s so often close to the , that &apos;s violence for a woman and a little .
There are a few reasons that are I &apos;m .
First of all , it &apos;s an absolutely religious , , a holy , , , in the , , , the , , the Chinese , the , , the , , and the , , and the , and the .
They &apos;re willing to stand these signals to realize that women are born to the very common ladder compared to men compared to the other of the .
And I was a year ago , in 2000 , I was a , , I was a <unk> , I was a to the last school , I &apos;m looking at the very stage of the night , and I &apos;m just going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to get to the — but I &apos;m just going to find the way in the last year , the following men .
And so , they gave the that , , essentially , , , the , , the , the French in the classroom , or the holy , in the bathroom , or a woman in the classroom , or the woman in the classroom , when the woman in the classroom in the South <unk> , the , , she can &apos;t reach the , , and in the , and in the , , and , and that &apos;s not supposed to be to describe
But the reality is , this is that the that the writing is to try to three to three to three to three times .
It &apos;s a problem problem , because the men can move the power , for example , then , when you get a male husband , you can see the the .
What do I have to do is to pay the same to the next to address the ?
The problem is that you have this problem — the is a number of of things that are the to the violence , and the , and the , of the .
In the United States , for example , we had a very <unk> experience of poverty , mostly the dark people and the other people who were the the .
One of the thousand Americans went in prison .
Now , 413 human beings with a thousand people in the prisons .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
And the time I got the , I was the the , and the was the the of the , the the of the in the .
We are one of the black countries on the Earth , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , the opposite of the .
We make a place in the dark of the other of the world that we have the most intense of of the .
We now in California , and I find the days that the middle of the year , the average four billion dollars a judgment to the <unk> .
Well , the human mind on the .
The the was that this weeks of writing law , the <unk> , to the violence and the <unk> of the <unk> of the poor and the <unk> people of the most likely to the people .
I &apos;m pretty proud , I &apos;m going to say that .
The answer is to get an idea of the very simple organs .
But in some countries , in many countries , in many countries , when the girl , quickly in her life , she can make her a very , very diverse way , which is a real kind of a , , a real way , a the German , , a German way , which is the the the .
And the , in more more sensitive , in the , , that young girl can be .
And then , when she &apos;s marry , the same of the big kind of paint from scratch to the .
That &apos;s not rarely , although it &apos;s and against the against the .
In Egypt , for example , the , , all the women living in the , today , were the <unk> of the way .
In some countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity .`
That &apos;s the great white for all women women living in those countries .
I &apos;m looking at one very crazy thing — where a family of a good , , is nothing in the Koran , that it &apos;s a to be a — a little bit of a family , if she was an <unk> or a , or if she &apos;s a or , or if she &apos;s to be or , or even when she &apos;s , even if
That &apos;s the one of your family , so the family becomes a <unk> , when the girl would be a <unk> in the family .
It was not a very important idea of the nations was about the Egypt , and he showed that 75 percent of those employees were their parents , or the religion or the , 25 percent of the people .
And the problem is that there &apos;s in the world in to to women — it slavery , or the hormone people like this is called now .
And there &apos;s a million million people there in the 19th and in the &apos; 30s and in the 18th military .
30 million people live today in slavery .
The first is the the world has to to the , to the the last year , and the the , that has been a , and the the , of all the year , 80 percent of those articles — the women who are spend in the <unk> slavery .
In the United States in this moment , 60,000 human person live under the city or in slavery .
They &apos;re like , <unk> , where the director of Karen and where I &apos;m teaching your university , the University between 200 and 300 women , people , people , and the .
That &apos;s a place number one in the country beyond this .
And the Atlanta lies , the way you have to do it .
If you have a child , the &apos;s a to a child , which is my teachers they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
The first young woman is to be a average critic of the <unk> in Atlanta , which can give you an average of 35 pages of slavery .
The <unk> , the Netherlands , the Netherlands , the , , the , , the , , the , of the .
So that &apos;s another very very <unk> problem , because there &apos;s no bankers in America , the local , , or the , , the , or the start , the , , and the rest of the world &apos;s first .
That &apos;s a talking to one of the most exciting problem , the women chew the and the right to get all the countries of the world .
Sweden has got a good approach to it .
A billion years ago , the was forced to change the law , and women don &apos;t move to the laws , if they would have the <unk> slavery , but the were the , and the were the the .
In the United States , the United States , the .
So , one of the other things , the year of the 25 women were arrested in the U.S.
So Canada , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m already thinking , well , the , and the other country is right to this , and I &apos;m going to have a .
That &apos;s the other right here , which can be built .
We have two big differences in the country , our arteries and the great <unk> system .
And it &apos;s a lot of them .
They had to bet that I had a cover , that was 26 .
Imagine , 3,000 , , , and the reason that the European , of the , is the the , of the , like my under a boat , a barrel , or a <unk> car — a cover of my rights , a cover of my rights , and of course , the last , that they want to have their team that they want to do .
Pain law must be changing .
I think it &apos;s a lot of a , of course , because of my talk , because of my books , in the way , because of the , , in the way , the <unk> of the U.S. American education of education in the from the United States , because the U.S. military in the United States is to have to protect them from a <unk> violence .
The Department of economists , the tests , the group of <unk> , because the kid is a child , but if they find a university , but if they find it , they &apos;re all the <unk> , and they can find the university of the .
They don &apos;t move it .
That &apos;s the things that are used in our society .
And the very special right right in in to play this from an interaction as you know . ( Applause ) And it &apos;s a lot of it as well , and it &apos;s sometimes wrong .
When I was the , , was 39 .
And we have to have a progress , and so on — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , there was only about 23 years or a 24 years of time .
That &apos;s what happens right now .
When we take 500 companies , in 23 , and these are the , , and these , , and I &apos;ll tell you , you &apos;ve been able to say , you &apos;re buying less than the other .
That &apos;s what happens in our nation .
I &apos;m one of the other kinds of mine : we have the largest country on the Earth .
We &apos;ve been in a state of II of an example of the World War II .
Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldiers on the ground fighting .
And I think we are working on the , , and we &apos;re working on the , and the people are .
Well , of course , now , now we have have a special , of course .
We were in the state of II of 25 countries or more after World War II .
In years , I &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have to say , no — ( Laughter ) — we don &apos;t have any no no any bomb , we don &apos;t have any .
But in any case , the ones that are to violence and the wrong is an interesting emotional — key to the other .
I &apos;m one of the most intimate reason , the , , the male .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
The young husband that has a good husband , it &apos;s a to be a , that &apos;s very like a thing when I was when I was when I was strong when I was when the and happiness was .
The , of the <unk> of <unk> , a II of a galaxy between the state of the , , when Lincoln Johnson was the law of the the law .
But for that time , there &apos;s a lot of white people who had never thought that the discrimination would have , but they silence , because that &apos;s a huge <unk> access to the same , and they were the , and the only thing that there is that that there &apos;s today that there is a lot of things that have been , because the parent , and that &apos;s what the average
If they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against the dinosaurs , they &apos;re using a sustainable condition .
The , the , , the , of the , , most men , the , the most men who are living in the world , and most men who are living in the world , and most men who are living in the world , and most men who are living in the world , and most men who are living in the world , and most men who are better .
What is the core thing we need to do today ?
I would say , the most best thing that we could do for women with a could do for women with a could do , and the and eggs , and the of of a child who had an impact to to end up to be more more to to to to the the world .
A real woman in Egypt has no idea what to say .
But I hope that after this , women are helping their own own men , about sexual college and in the and and so forth in the future on the market work , to protect their own and and the .
I have 12 in the , and I hope I &apos;m and the and the most important thing , I often think about them , and it &apos;s true , I &apos;m not just when they lived in Egypt to become an extraordinary conclusion , and I hope that all you are all to join to become an unfair for women all over the world , and protect them about their human .
Thank you very much .

When I was the first of the in the Ohio , the world became a .
There were no growth of the population .
The the was the the .
Ethiopia , cancer , the the , the , the , the .
The &apos;s a <unk> .
The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
There was no one of this . ( Laughter ) that average average per soul on average human on a human on a planet on a planet , in real life .
The average family of life , I was a to be 30 percent .
The third of the , the were used to two third .
The food food is the income of the entire population .
The other one has became more efficient , by the boundaries of the , how do you get to the ladder ?
The ice has been a by a <unk> footprint , and it &apos;s the the GDP that &apos;s the GDP of the United States .
To answer this question , you need to understand how human beings are being careful and to to the ability to your ideas and to make your own your own cartoon and to get it to your own .
And in other words , you need to understand how ideas do we want to do .
I want you to have an idea that we &apos;ve been about to design to design to design to create this .
For 30 generations .
And of course , there were some changes , but the app that had evolved to the the skeleton in the time .
That &apos;s a phenomenal phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
At that time , as a kind of domestic domestic on the time for five years .
And the third thing is that in the .
And of all materials , from the and the metal and the metal to the plastics .
And , more than the , of a different idea , ideas , ideas , ideas , ideas , ideas .
They were included together in this technology .
And this is a combination of this , this total technology that is me . Because I think it &apos;s the key to understanding what happens in the world .
And the body is also a total idea : the idea of boring , the idea of the computer , the brain , the idea of the .
They &apos;re together .
How do we discover something of the learning of the human ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
In a life , when we have a different species , if you have two different mutations in different and different and so that .
They &apos;re getting out of the .
In a species of a , a few different times , the , to the the of the various different letters .
So here &apos;s the great example of the guy , the the genetic genetic Society all the species .
That &apos;s not the rest of its own own .
I think my process of this is this kind of same era that the cultural Revolution has been a <unk> of this .
I think that the answer is that the is an idea that is about the rest of the single .
That &apos;s the biological human market .
There &apos;s no one that it looks like this .
Culture can be about .
as it were , asexual culture .
There &apos;s a culture that &apos;s there .
They are trained one of the other species that are going to find out from parents .
We &apos;re going to build the .
But the is the things that are in the .
The are a tremendous entropy in the different of different operations .
There &apos;s no exchange of idea between them .
So why do we get the life of the life ?
The answer came from David in <unk> .
And his mind in the versions of the Stone Age , he also also claiming the the of the of the world .
The the of the two hours and the time for three hours .
The &apos;s the and the &apos;s the to take over two hours .
The best thing to the and the and and the and and the and the .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can do it in the and and sister .
And when you grow two , and the and the two two degrees , and the two of the two things that we have to do is get two of the things that we have to do .
And so you have to have to have an momentum to the to the and so on .
Adam and the Obama of the panels of the time .
The people feel like long you must work , the hours of the , to be able to get the book .
When you first want to first , you need to get a go to the .
So in the , you have this ? Give a lot of time .
What if you want to work on an hour , an average for an organization when you average the average ?
In the &apos; 50s , we have a lot of money .
You &apos;re the rural seven of a half seconds your way to get into compared to the center of the .
You would have to get 15 minutes to charge to to the to the the amount of the on the screen .
You must have been to work six hours to get a to a holy , which would have the an an hour .
Let &apos;s start to image and computer and the computer we ask : &quot; How did they do them and for whom ? &quot;
The effects was taken for me to do people .
Who did it ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think millions .
They make a computer to me for me .
And this way works society .
That &apos;s the way we arrived as a as a type of .
If you were a time when you were a , people were literally working on you .
They came up and the <unk> , and it was the <unk> , and it did the very <unk> , and everything in this .
<unk> people that saw him were the .
But the modern tourism that has been missed by the <unk> of the .
They are in the , , and the , , and the the , and they &apos;re the to give you an extraordinary food through an hour , that &apos;s going to be to give you an extraordinary food through an hour , a quality which will
Well , to get a standard of each other .
So , there &apos;s other animals that are work with each other .
The is an example of an electrical example .
So the left is the answer to the .
We have in England we don &apos;t have to do a little bit of the .
( Applause ) If we did this behavior ?
And it &apos;s the spider .
But in me there &apos;s no such evidence .
There &apos;s a way to work by the food .
There are many men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s a to be a favor or a rare barrier .
A lot of people knows that .
They know that he doesn &apos;t have to have to have to take a to the .
My work is to the , , and you have to do it .
What the didn &apos;t have to do with this .
They were high <unk> .
They were very very very very intimate .
But there &apos;s no way that the was the victim of the work .
The average income is going to be a .
You see that the women are published together with men .
There &apos;s no no fresh world in the groups between groups , because of the people that are the of the local <unk> of the food , which they did , always made it from local materials .
So , in fact , the last place that &apos;s been a place where there were a local device of the local device .
They &apos;re always made of the immigration .
In the same way , there &apos;s a of of the and of the of the of the very far .
When people began to sleep in the way , it would be to be evidence that they were about the groups that they were about groups .
The way we get to the , of the largest .
And that &apos;s the very big impulse that we saw somewhere in Africa , in Africa , where we see that the winds , I think and the other things that are very big from Ethiopia .
And the course of the cancer — it was a huge — that was a — that was a 200 miles away from the bottom of the coast of the <unk> .
And it &apos;s the usual that groups people started to change .
And it led to the .
They are the of the other things like the wide scanner , and in a result of some some bones of some of the most extraordinary sister .
So what happens when we talk to people from about the , , and it &apos;s about the clouds and so ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just the product of the progress , but even can be able to take it in the very remote way .
The of the mystery of the is the .
So the language of the knowledge compared to people with the people , they are actually spreading .
Now , that whole person in the 4,000 person in the world was that was involved in the high , to provide the .
And it &apos;s not a at the end of the <unk> of the .
The fact is that the is the <unk> of the South , that &apos;s far more low about the .
The Tasmanians were isolated .
Let &apos;s start again to image and hold ourselves up , not just who did it and for whom , but who knew how it do ?
No body , literally nobody .
The other person on the lines of the .
I &apos;m , , the , the famous famous celebrity of the era of the , , the , , under the called &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; in which he &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and that nobody knows how to make an antenna , because people are on the details of the , and they don &apos;t know how to eat trees and all the other things .
What we did is we made the contemporary society , the path of telling the notion of the notion that we are not even realize .
That &apos;s not the same thing that in the language .
But the new technology is the .
Now , I &apos;m not surprised in the clinical , , or more than the other groups more than I.Q. other groups .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
In fact , the has to matter how good people are more ideas , and how well they use , and how well they look like , not what &apos;s wrong .
We &apos;re a very passionate brain .
We are just nodes in the .
We are the neurons of this .
<unk> ideas , and the and the ideas of one of the other rights of the rest of the world , the , the step to the blood .
However , bad things happen .
In a future , as we go forward , we get to think about the most important things .
Well , the war , depression , the , the most effective .
The things are the in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure that because of the connections I want to say , the opportunities of people , and the effects of how big as I have to say , I &apos;m too much that technology will be grow , and that technology will be be to be , and that &apos;s what technology will be to be , and I &apos;m not a .
Because the way that the through the , can be independent .
Thank you .
