I &apos;m talking about the fact that we have discovered .
I work with the Sun .
And I &apos;m going to take a little bit of our little red dot and do this .
It &apos;s a very subtle thing to do to this .
It &apos;s a little video that we &apos;re all talking about .
So , this is a piece of thumb .
It can be a little bit of a time when it comes to a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t think — I &apos;ll just — I &apos;m going to go through this feeling — I &apos;m not going to pass the same thing .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> .
( Music ) This is not — ( Laughter ) — this is not a — ( Music ) ( Laughter ) — this is not the case .
Okay . ( Laughter )
The world is the size of a planet .
Oh , so it was the year .
Okay . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to see you . ( Laughter )
So let me just say , what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
And so , after a few minutes , I would say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re a little bit of a bit of your body , you &apos;re going to learn how to make your life in your life . &quot; &quot; And I hope
We are curious about the language of self , but it &apos;s also the language of other parts of our own .
The fundamental players are getting us wondering : ( Laughter ) — or <unk> , or whatever , or whatever , or whatever , or something like that .
<unk> : That &apos;s the number of numbers coming home .
This lucky cop is the equivalent of the United States of America .
And when it &apos;s — it &apos;s going to go head . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to do it . We &apos;re tired .
It &apos;s all over .
We try to make it invisible to the man .
As you see , they are very , very important , and people are doing things like this .
And it turns out that this is the way that we have to be , and the emotional and powerful , the emotional .
We tend to complete the fact that they are not supposed to be able to do the kind of <unk> that we have .
We can &apos;t , if we help us with our own power , we can &apos;t do it . We cannot cut it out .
And then , let &apos;s see , we &apos;re going to turn it into the force .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
I see that MBA is very high in the MBA of the MBA .
And they can be thrown on their own , and they &apos;re going to be in the room , and they &apos;re going to be in the room , and they &apos;re going to be on the floor , and
They &apos;re slightly holding two of the two sides of the room .
They &apos;re in this direction .
They don &apos;t have a little bit of a sense of <unk> .
They are the <unk> and the <unk> , and they &apos;re all in this direction .
I was a few of the results for my time .
The first one is to ignore you , which is going to be a very short kick .
It &apos;s largely dependent on what it means to be .
So women are more likely to put in this law , and the females are more likely to put in this law .
And the sum of the children are not being more likely to be more than their individual male personality and not rational .
And it &apos;s also also known as <unk> .
And it &apos;s very important for their MBA to do this , because they &apos;re also taking care of their own .
We have the opportunity to put our money into the program .
The woman who is ready to spin , the women and women are finally connected to the end of the line and they &apos;re connected .
I started to think , well , the word is more often in the search for this kind of information .
If they show these videos , what do they want to do , and why would they better bring their kids into this ?
And the lie that were going to be true , that would be true .
Can we make more powerful sense of our ability to change our experience of change , our behavior change , than we can ?
We know that the gesture of jazz and gestures are just thinking about us and think about the other way around .
But the question that makes us think about us is that these words are also called <unk> .
But we also have to be able to keep in the way that we are , in our own females , in our own hands .
That &apos;s both true .
It &apos;s also about the power of power .
We tend to think that we are very strong , and yet we are still very strong , but we also feel powerful that we can be used to be strong .
As we know , as we know , our thinking about changing our way to change our thinking .
How do I get out of the way of talking about the feeling of being a person ?
And I &apos;m from the idea of the physics and the feeling of physics , and I can see that it &apos;s hormones , and it &apos;s hormones . I &apos;ve been learning hormones .
What is the idea of thinking about the relative group of people ?
Not a lot of us are naive , but people who are strong people are not <unk> .
We don &apos;t say two words , and you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you think ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Please , &quot; &quot; or
And I &apos;m going to give them a sense of how to live with them .
They chose to play the risk of the risk of creating risks .
And it &apos;s about 60 percent of the time , and that &apos;s how important it is .
And this is what we &apos;re going to do with the test .
I was looking at 20 percent of the time that the people who were brothers from the same experience were at the time of the group , and it &apos;s the most rare decade of the year .
So two lines of this change will be to change these changes .
And in the last 20 years , these are the things that they &apos;re going to do .
I have been looking at the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , which is the only percent of the 15 percent .
<unk> , two minutes of change , more and more of our brain , and it &apos;s more obvious , and it &apos;s more like a sense of feeling <unk> and feeling <unk> .
This is our feeling of being raw , OK ?
We are not supposed to be the only way that we think about ourselves , our own ability to think about ourselves and to make it in our own way .
And my self is changing the way it is .
The question that makes us interested in the fact that we have a few secrets of the value of our life , the kind of force that we have to change .
This is a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
And so , can you imagine the beauty in the real world ?
It &apos;s the kind of thing that makes us think about it .
And so , the idea that we can do this poses to the social justice of the Internet that is based on the social security .
Am I going to be a little bit ?
This is the <unk> table for innovation .
They &apos;re a school meeting for the kids .
It &apos;s a <unk> interview , or it &apos;s a business of a job .
We &apos;ve got to come up with a lot of work , because you &apos;ve got a lot of your own work , because you &apos;re going to have a lot of it .
So we started our temple , and we had a lot of them , and we said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we do that ? &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we have to do it
( Laughter ) And fortunately , we &apos;ve been denied this idea . We don &apos;t have no slides .
You don &apos;t think it &apos;s obvious .
It &apos;s not with their heads .
You &apos;re not allowed to have your own self .
What do you do before you start ?
You sit up and you sit in touch with your hands or your Android .
Look , you can see , you can go to your feet , you can gather your own . Actually , that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do , and you &apos;re sitting there . You &apos;re sitting on the road .
We wanted to say that we wanted to go .
Remittances have taken a lot of my work on the lab , and they &apos;ve been trained to get a lot of new jobs and powerful supplies .
He was taken with five minutes of interviews .
We &apos;ve taught us that the effect of the nest is not the same as the ability to use the <unk> tools to take care of them . They &apos;re looking at this stuff .
And it &apos;s more than just a <unk> of the Koran , and it &apos;s more than just a little more than a <unk> .
Nobody ever love it .
The <unk> <unk> that he called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called the <unk> journey .
We had a interview with a interview with a stranger .
And then we showed these guys to four .
From the exception , our eye had passed through our eyes .
They had no idea of being treated , and after we looked at the video , they had to show up , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to take this stuff to work .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to take you to work .
And the other is more mobile . &quot; &quot; What is it that &apos;s going to change ?
That &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s dependent on the ones that are involved in their own .
We looked at other people &apos;s data , and so , for example , what do you think is wrong ?
Who have you ?
There was no evidence of this .
What the effects of the effects are not .
People were alone in their real time .
So they did not bother themselves .
They were not able to show themselves a lot of their own , they would have been .
And the result is this effect .
And when I say people , we think our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , can change our behavior , and I say , &quot; &quot; Is this not a little bit of a genius ?
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be true enough .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t want to say that I want to tell you about the real world .
I don &apos;t want to be a chef .
I &apos;m not going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get a lot of these words and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I want to tell you that I &apos;m not here . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to talk to a little story about it .
At the age of 19 , I had a lot of heavy hunting .
The way that we can do it is to do it .
I was surrounded by a few times .
I didn &apos;t have the same experience of the literature , I got to the <unk> , and I was standing in the morning , and I kept keeping the news , and that was very painful for me .
I was also familiar with the <unk> , because I was a kid who was crying from the mother and I was a kid .
I was trying to get back to the <unk> .
They &apos;re all about to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ll never finish the painting .
Things that I &apos;m not sure about the things that you &apos;re in , but you don &apos;t have the right to do it — I &apos;ve got to go into this , and I &apos;ve got to tell you , you know , the general experience of your life , you know , the kind of thing that you &apos;re going to have to do , you &apos;re not going to be able to get it out of your body .
I was feeling utterly naive .
I was working , I was working on , I was in my apartment , and I was going to have a reputation .
I finished the arm .
I became a <unk> , and I was going to have four years of my servant , and I was tired of the ceremony , and I was asked , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be a writer . &quot; &quot; I was reminded of the &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; moment .
I was a <unk> .
I &apos;m not saying that 20 of the people who are in the U.S.
It was the night .
I was scared of the night sky , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I ever know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , you know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a drink .
It &apos;s the same , and you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make it , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a genius .
And it &apos;s about the size of a future .
You &apos;re going to be doing all the things you &apos;re not going to do .
And if you &apos;re going to , you know , if you &apos;re tired , you &apos;re going to be honest , and you &apos;re going to be listening to me , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a little bit of a genius !
You know , I &apos;m going to be able to work with my grandfather . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve done this .
I can read the high school education in the school , a few years ago , and I &apos;m a <unk> , and I &apos;m not thinking about it , I &apos;m going to be working on a <unk> , and I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to be there .
After the first year , I had a conversation with the <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , it &apos;s not about the same .
And so , I was in the wrong condition , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think I &apos;m a place .
And that &apos;s the turn of the time .
And two things happened .
And the first thing I can do is I can &apos;t get that feeling .
But he was so frustrated and he was like me .
And then , I had to understand it , and I knew it was okay .
So , it could also be able to do that .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s the right thing .
You can show the right to get the right to the morning , and you &apos;ll come into the room , and I go to the room . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you can give me a very good chance . &quot; &quot; And he was wondering , &quot; &quot; Well , this is a couple of months ago , and it &apos;s got a while . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A few months later , I was going to see that he was sitting there , and he was there , and he was going to be there , he was in the middle of his life .
It changed .
I would like to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m going to be a writer .
<unk> the reality of the future .
You want to be a bit of a genius , you know .
You know what I &apos;m going to be like ?
And the normal one can bring in a huge change in the way that they can make change .
Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , let me tell you , two lines .
Two questions , two minutes , two minutes .
You &apos;ll be able to do a research before you put it in a site , and two minutes , and try to do it , in the middle of the room , in the middle of the room , in the middle of the room ,
You know what you want to do .
You &apos;re the first to be the best to be the best of your brain .
You &apos;ll have your prototype . You reduce your <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , I can &apos;t stop showing them the show . &quot; &quot; Just to give you a sense of what I &apos;m going to do with the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure I can tell them I &apos;m going to tell them who I am and I &apos;m going to show you . &quot; &quot; You can walk .
You can &apos;t tell me how long you &apos;ve got to take this body with your head , and I &apos;m going to take you through the steps of the very first , because that &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s not — ( Laughter ) — this is not the kind of thing that we learned that we learned about and how people are going to be , because if you know that you can &apos;t benefit from it , people who are not aware
And I think that they can use it to do it , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can use it to do it .
Because the two aspects of the body in the cores can also change their life as well .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have lots of adults .
The one that &apos;s the most likely to <unk> the fisheries of their fisheries .
And the more women are , the workers are the ones that are being trained for survival .
They had found the emergence of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Qatar is a great , <unk> , honest , necessary business , and they don &apos;t have to be done .
Here , in the opposite , the 90 percent of the product , 90 percent of the product .
And the <unk> of the Catholic is a very remarkable job , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the new <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
<unk> are actually a few more <unk> cars , and they &apos;re made out of metal and they &apos;re made out of metal and they &apos;re going to be able to do a little bit of the size .
And this is the reason that I had to meet the advice of my life .
I am a writer and I &apos;m activists and I am a mathematician , and the foundation of politics and the essence of the world is about the norms of democracy and the survival of the community .
I was in the &apos; 2007 , and I was still in the middle of my work , and I was in the middle of my work .
But I was also the <unk> .
My colleagues and I were also very familiar with art and <unk> , and they helped us to make it easier for themselves .
These days , they are in the middle of the region and the socioeconomic meditation .
And so , this is the kind of thing that I &apos;m going to meet with the world around me .
I &apos;ve been very <unk> in the world , and I &apos;ve been a lot of <unk> and I &apos;ve been privileged .
I came to the ground , not only the <unk> of the <unk> , but the <unk> .
In the case of the <unk> , in the <unk> year , I came to the countries in the literature , in the city , and in the country , in the United States .
And I realized that this is a lot more than a human being , because it was a big thing .
And then I created a movement that said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to create a <unk> movement under my <unk> , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) — and it &apos;s a movement that is a movement that is known for me .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is a wonderful movement to help and to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the reason for that was to make sure that the <unk> of our <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
They also put together with other tools , and they also , of course , the <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> .
And the last time I was going to the top of the study , it would be a lot of the size of the big , big , big , big , big , big , big , big , big , big ,
&quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro .
But we created a <unk> <unk> that was made of a <unk> , which is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> .
So the dough would know that he was going to go .
In two years , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the middle of the local school , and in the
We &apos;d put it in the back of the closet , and the people who were being made , the people who were being made and valued .
They knew that they could have taken the results of the eye and the other way that they could , and they knew that they had to do with their community .
Now , I can tell you , we have to take a look at the <unk> and the other , and we can &apos;t get to the old <unk> and we can &apos;t get them to learn .
Try to see whether or not you have any limitations and no limitations .
You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s not a luxury , it &apos;s 20 million people in the world .
And as I &apos;m going to see him , I don &apos;t know if anybody is going to be a part of our community , and that &apos;s a part of our community .
You know , thank you , thank you .
( Applause )
In the last five years , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the leader of the <unk> .
The first thing that happened was that the British , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the New York School of <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
The <unk> plan was a <unk> of the <unk> .
But sadly , 1993 was not the winning sign of the Earth &apos;s program .
And the last time he was in the last year , he was a well-known well-known .
I &apos;m going to tell you how I &apos;m going to do it .
In 1983 , in the &apos; 83 , &apos; 83 , I was just finishing a professional , <unk> teacher in the <unk> , and my teacher had been trained to the world , and I was always looking for the world for a
After my age , my parents started to change the way they changed .
I had a lot of Islamic Islamic , a lot of people who had a lot of trouble going on .
I &apos;ve learned this : if people who are not aware of the human , we &apos;ve learned them , and it &apos;s not just that the images are going to be the same as the one that &apos;s out there , but it
Every religion in every single religion , every single one of them , is that they can be used to build their own way to build a <unk> , or whatever , to their own beliefs , to help people with their beliefs .
I spent a couple of months before I got started , and I spent a couple of weeks trying to get a couple of weeks of strangers to a couple of weeks ago .
I was told I went to the top of the closet .
We had the heart of our <unk> , we knew , we didn &apos;t know that the central secret of the orchestra was in the secret .
And when I was a fan of my <unk> , he threw me on my van , and he was feeling how to get 30 metronomes .
The last little girl I did , the last laugh that I had ever had , was the little <unk> that I had to get out of the box , and I was surprised to be a bit of a <unk> .
My grandfather said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; — and the girl said , &quot; &quot; The horse is a little girl .
And I was laughing with this word , but I found out that after a few years , I had to find out what they were doing .
They had to be the one that I had , and they thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have to do the same thing .
And in the last year , these people are 700 pounds of the world &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who has been trained to have a <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> , and a lot of people who have been trained from a
I &apos;m going to take my responsibility to my community and I can &apos;t help but see the other people .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> person , &quot; &quot; and I was the people that I was calling .
I had been living in the age of 20 , 20 years old , and my kids had been trained for less than a year .
We would have been a bit of a genius to a self , and I would have no other experience .
Every time I was a new one , I was raised on the foundation of the comic child .
I was given my identity to be a <unk> , but I was also going to be the <unk> , and it was the only way that the <unk> and the ball would be the best and <unk> .
So I was able to read a lot of my talk , and I was going to read a lot of my own paper , and I was able to watch play .
I was not really prepared to be the case of this because I was not prepared to be the one that was the kind of life that was being in the middle of a city , but I was not prepared to be the truth
I &apos;m also standing in a field where people are familiar with the way we think and the way it is .
What happened to my eye ?
I was the first to think of this as a year of time when one of the first projects of the project was the year 2000 .
I was reminded of the University of the government , the government of the National Institute , which is the case of the government .
And I had the privilege of being in the middle of the room and the most part of the life room , and I was not a person who was a part of the life of the child who had been in trouble with the
The ones that were most committed to the most were the most frequent highways of the world .
I was able to learn that I was a member of a boy who was a friend of mine who I was in the last day .
And this is a number of days ago , but I also came to realize that there &apos;s no such thing as a <unk> , that there &apos;s no <unk> in the middle of the conversation .
I didn &apos;t have the same time , I didn &apos;t have the right to be the kind of thing that I had to know , and I was just a little bit like the <unk> that I had for my life .
And the more I started to make a more participation version of this , the more I got to the <unk> in the &apos; 60s , the <unk> .
I was also the people who had been involved in the various beliefs of the world , and that was the way I was going to be in the literature .
I had to say that I had to be able to have a greater impact on the fact that the golden rule was the only way that the <unk> could be affected by the fact that the universe was being affected .
And I was also going to work on a work , which is the most <unk> , the most likely people who have been to the top of the study , and I &apos;ve been working on the most <unk> and least of the people
I &apos;ve been a familiar love , and I &apos;m a very familiar one , like a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and I &apos;m not asking myself to do anything I can &apos;t like to do .
I would have to be able to do this with the fact that I would have been able to take a look at my experience of the brave people who had been trained to me with my life .
I don &apos;t know how to be a <unk> , but I &apos;m not really good at what the rest of the room is .
And then I was &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the Great Line . &quot; &quot; I had to come to my <unk> , and I had to be honest about the fact that the person was going to be honest , and the irony of the person and the world was not that much of a sense of
Conor had been hiding in the same way that I had to speak to the rest of my life , in the moment of my life .
My journey to the world was very interesting , and I had to tell the world more inclusive of my world , my digital cousins , and my father , and I realized that they were not going to be in the interest of me .
I was reminded of a day in the days of my day , and my mother said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry to be a writer , &quot; &quot; and my mother said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what I &apos;m going to do with my life .
So , my point was that , in fact , I had to look at the eyes of the eyes , and look at the eye of the eye , and say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about people .
I understood how much energy I had in the sense of being a moral instrument in the moment of being able to do something .
And my <unk> , the real <unk> , is not the real step .
I did change my family with my family , when I was a family , and I had to change the way that I started .
Why did I get my own , and I was going to get the status quo ?
It &apos;s easy to see .
I hope that , if you think about , what happens is that , in one of the ways that I have been thinking about , then there &apos;s a lot of the work that I have to say to be the most honest way to go , and I &apos;m not suggesting that there &apos;s a lot
I chose to use it , and I could choose to use the same as the way I was in the process of being a writer .
You can use these thermal <unk> and their opportunities to the rest of the term , and to give them a sense of humor and adaptation .
I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that the more I have been involved in the value of these people , the more I have to be able to get a handle on the ground .
As my father , I &apos;m going to tell you , is that the way to go to the top of the world and to go to the top of the world , is that there &apos;s no way to go to the road to the road and to walk .
I don &apos;t know .

Your morning !
<unk> ?
They took the name of the summer , and I asked them to go back to the door , and I asked them to ask the word why the word was in Arabic language in the midst of the so-called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the <unk> language .
Who is writing ? Well , who is the problem ? All right , no problem .
I was sitting at a restaurant in the restaurant for a day , and I was making a food .
I was looking at my office and said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s your ?
He looked at me , and he looked at me as a strange thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; He answered , &quot; &quot; What do they call ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , what do they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Lord is &quot; &quot; is right ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , you know what ? &quot; &quot; The office said , &quot; &quot; The office said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a Chinese , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the headline said , &quot; &quot; Oh , come
He was just too good at telling me that he was good at the world , and he said , &quot; &quot; If the most challenging girl is the most <unk> girl in this world , I can &apos;t look at her .
What do we have to say about &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
I had the same <unk> boy , who was the kind of boy that I had , who was the kind of guy that was going on .
Would that have the ability to talk about this ?
I started to think about my grandfather .
And this is the kind of thing that I did .
This is a guy who &apos;s really just a guy .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s the way to talk about themselves in the real world .
Is this going to be another way to get out of the other ?
How did we get ?
But we have , like , a lot of the guy here , who is kind of like a <unk> , and they &apos;re putting it on their own , and they &apos;re just like , &quot; &quot; Everything that &apos;s been done with me and I don &apos;t know about them .
I &apos;m going to have to forget my whole self , my ideas , my understanding , and my translation of all my faith .
The child &apos;s children who had been in the late Middle Ages could be our best .
I think it &apos;s because I have to do everything that I learned in Arabic language .
Don &apos;t forget to have to remember ?
Who was here ?
And so , despite all this , I tried to understand it .
I wanted to do it with my commitment to my grandmother , and I didn &apos;t want to do anything about it .
The Arabic is not giving the movie to the child .
It &apos;s not language , it &apos;s not language , it &apos;s not language , and it &apos;s not language that we &apos;re used to doing a great review of the work we used to be in our work , not the language of the science that we used to do .
If we had stopped , they would have our clothes .
So I &apos;m going to use my wish to use my wish to be in the language .
You can &apos;t help but do it in the context of education . Do you need it ?
It &apos;s a reality .
But there &apos;s another point that we have to think about .
The language is language language .
And it &apos;s called , you know , you must be in the literature to be absolutely cool in the language of language .
It &apos;s a place where we don &apos;t know about the other way around the fundamental language in language .
Is it ?
<unk> <unk> , who &apos;s the first time she started to write her in the first year of her school , was using her to use her language to speak .
Her idea of her , her mind , was a little girl , and she was a little boy who was a little girl who was a little girl <unk> than her .
So when he started writing in English , he had enough damage to him .
You know , you can read his essay in English , and he &apos;s always in his writing room , and you &apos;re feeling the feeling of the eye .
You know , you know , the guy who is the author in English , he &apos;s the guy who &apos;s got the same way to the mountain .
It &apos;s a kind of a <unk> .
Secondly , if you want to kill a mile , you will kill the language of the mile , and the way it kills is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a sense of the fact that the individual society is a place of the same .
The Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> — these miles — these miles of generosity .
And so , they &apos;re all laws in their own language .
They are the ones that go to the ground .
And they use it to be used to make a living in the language of language , to move the language of language .
We know more about them ?
Well , we &apos;ve been able to do this in the world , and we would have been able to keep it out of the world and to think about the world with the world .
And once again , the development of the development of the building was that , in fact , the <unk> , the country , and the other , the countries , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they were also not able to do it .
They held language to their own .
Because if you take a product and you can buy a product that &apos;s in a space , it &apos;s not just the product , it &apos;s not the kind of product that &apos;s going on in its country , it &apos;s not the kind of product .
You don &apos;t believe in your native product .
They &apos;ve been able to have been able to be used as a species , like we &apos;ve been in the late &apos; 70s .
So they became aware of themselves and their language to make their own language .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> , underwater , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in Arabic , &quot; &quot; Does it stop ?
Have you ever misplaced the representation , OK ?
And who is there , and how do you think it &apos;s going to be ?
And the idea is that the words that we &apos;re going to have to do is squeeze the word , the way it is .
Language is the kind of challenge that we have in our lives and our capacity to understand the term that &apos;s based on our own lives .
So , we have a certain kind of life , like the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the private <unk> , and you have some sense of the mathematics in the mathematics .
It &apos;s a story , two or three , or three , or three .
It &apos;s the idea that we can think of how we think we think about how we think about how we can do our own , and how we see it in our other world .
What is the picture of a machine ?
You can say , well , this is how you get to deal with the human being .
So , I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , it &apos;s a little bit like the water , the water , the <unk> , the <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the boy said , &quot; &quot; Dad , you know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of sorry .
Why is it that ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , you &apos;re going to go , I &apos;m going to go and talk to my empty space and I &apos;m not going to speak .
And this is what it means to be a part of the thing , and it &apos;s about remembering what is happening .
I have a wonderful family with a golf cart with golf .
I said , well , what do you do ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good for that . &quot; &quot; But I did not want to tell him a day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about the word &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; and then I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not
The dawn was , &quot; &quot; How can you make human beings ?
Would he have to do it ?
&quot; &quot; Am I going to be ? &quot; &quot; This is a couple of examples .
And so we started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , what do I think that &apos;s going to be a word for the story , and that &apos;s okay ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s interesting to understand that it &apos;s a matter of fact .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , my God , I &apos;m going to try and figure out why I &apos;m going to do this , and I &apos;ve done my life to the house , and I &apos;ve been trying to make my own way to my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the woman was trying to try to do that , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been out of my hands and I &apos;ve been to my mind . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the
And I can &apos;t help but do that .
( Applause ) How do we have to live the language of the language ?
We have the ability to do this , and we have to be able to do it in the same way that we can &apos;t speak to the community .
And so , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , why would you say , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you just say &quot; &quot; ?
It &apos;s a bit of a genius of your own , and it &apos;s fun to do . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no problem .
And the irony of jihad was to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the way to live with you , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to be a bit of a genius . &quot;
We said , &quot; &quot; Wow ! We don &apos;t do it . We don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t have to do that , because we didn &apos;t have to deal with this , because we didn &apos;t .
And if I can talk to you about that , I &apos;m going to tell you about the language of Arabic .
We don &apos;t want to be able to change our lives , and we have to do our own lives , our desire to do our desire for our desires and our lives .
And we can &apos;t have a sense of what &apos;s going on .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you know , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the answer is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> .
It &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s also creative and creative .
And then we started to get out of the box and we started to get out of the room .
You can &apos;t see that my husband &apos;s love , and he &apos;s going to be a member of the yellow line , and he &apos;s talking about the &quot; &quot; language of language . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s written in the written .
Why ? The word is not to kill language .
We don &apos;t need to kill our language .
If we were to kill our language , we would have to be our identity .
We must have to be our own .
We &apos;re going to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s a serious opportunity to be a serious and cultural way of being .
And then we started the stories of girls , and we found that girls and their homes and girls would spread .
&quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; is the images of girls and girls .
We &apos;re not going to be a lot of money !
And so , who said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a writer , you &apos;re not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m just going to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m just a bit more like a woman . &quot; &quot; But I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re better saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more like a good word .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go into the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because we don &apos;t have to be ourselves .
But what we need to believe is that if we have a sense of value , we can &apos;t give us a sense of what we &apos;re going to do , and we can &apos;t give us a sense of what it is that we &apos;re going to do , and that we can &apos;t do it , and you can see that it &apos;s going to be our creation and it &apos;s going to be that they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
It &apos;s the idea that it &apos;s not going to be a <unk> .
We can &apos;t see the universe , we can &apos;t fly into the universe and we can &apos;t know if we can &apos;t .
And yet , you &apos;re a great challenge .
It &apos;s a quality of the quality of the quality in your own .
We can start to see the future .
We can see the novel and the whole story .
We can make a novel that &apos;s going to be a new way of being .
And the language can be able to do this in a new way of being a new type of life .
We &apos;re not going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; No way , no way . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No way .
But we need to know , and we need to believe that the way we make it , the way we think about it , is that we &apos;re the debt .
And so , what do you do today ?
<unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> ?
And the next time you have a lot of my own , you know , I &apos;m going to say , you know , you &apos;re going to be in English , or you &apos;re in the wish .
But don &apos;t worry about the number of books in Arabic that you can &apos;t write in the literature .
( Applause ) This is a disaster , it &apos;s not a language .
You can see that it &apos;s going to be a viral world .
And so , it &apos;s not easy to say that it &apos;s going to go back to a place .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we have a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not going to be able to do this day in the morning .
We are here to be the first to be able to put this language in the middle of the room .
So , I &apos;m going to turn it into a place .
The first one is the essence of language , and it &apos;s actually <unk> .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the kind of thing you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say ,
( Applause ) So , the way we do is to make our own mistakes . ( Applause )
Over the years , I &apos;ve been thinking about this before , and I &apos;m going to say that the U.S.
I was trying to find a couple of things that would be a few of these days .
The last time you have a lot of time coming to the day , it &apos;s got a lot of time in the same way .
I was a picture of a day in a month , and I was a little bit of a picture .
I was going to be able to show you a few more people in the world .
I learned to make it , and I found that it was a lot of the same way that I could be in the middle of the room .
And so , I &apos;m going to say that we can &apos;t do this with the other day .
But you &apos;ll have to be the science of the science .
It &apos;s very , very bad .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m in the middle of the room .
No , I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say &quot; I &apos;m not a writer . &quot;
I learned that it was too difficult to do , and I could have been able to get it to the very existence of my own .
And in fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
I was reminded of the first day when I was a college , and I was going to have a sense of self .
I was a <unk> , from my <unk> , my eyes , and I started to work with a lot of the old and the way I was living with a lot of good and old .
It was a very powerful , very compelling image of the burden , and it was a very compelling image , and it was a very compelling image .
And , in fact , I was scared of a lot of my own , and I was scared of the lack of unique , <unk> , <unk> , and I was tired of the absence of my inner experience .
But I &apos;ve learned about these people who are very good at the same time .
He was so frustrated that he was so convinced that I could have seen it in the first place , and I &apos;d never seen it , and it didn &apos;t really have the same way that I started .
And as I was talking to the interview , I was struck by the same , and the wife was wearing a little bit of my life , and I was equal to the <unk> , and I was stuck in the room , and I was stuck in the middle of the room
It was not about the place that I was in . It was the light of the urban border and the point of view .
In the same way that you can put a book in the text , you can see the book in the sand .
&quot; &quot; Oh , he &apos;s hungry . &quot; &quot; I was equal .
It was a title .
And my day days , my brother , who was a little girl , was going to talk to me about the third one I had .
&quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re going to get it .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; What is it that &apos;s going to be done , and then I &apos;m a genius of the compassionate revolution , and I &apos;m going to give it up , and I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you an idea of
I was reminded of my own experience , and my real feeling of suffering , my experience , was that my life was always going to come to my place .
I didn &apos;t have the same time , but I felt my feeling , I was shocked by my body , and I was amazed to see that my body was going to be the barrier .
I didn &apos;t have any equipment , and I was just going to come up with it .
And this was the kind of question that went into the gift of looking forward to the fact : &quot; &quot; The normal people are not going to be seen as the kind of medium .
I started to get a drink in a very short , very short way . I gave it a big deal .
I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that I &apos;m painting my life .
And I saw my life , and I saw my goodness , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , &quot; &quot; as opposed to the <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what I was going to be in the middle of my life , &quot; &quot; and I had
I needed to have a sense of humor and I needed to have my own guidance and my skin .
And so , I &apos;m going to tell you , this is the moment when I was a kid .
I was born , and it was like , I &apos;m going to tell you , it &apos;s like a lot of the stuff that I &apos;m going to say to you , and I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to go to the floor .
For the same time , I used to be a <unk> , like the <unk> , and I was like , &quot; &quot; I want to say , I want to go , &quot; &quot; and I can &apos;t help but I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot;
I should have signed up for hours . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to be a <unk> .
And then you had to go back to the next time .
I was devastated by my father , when I was a <unk> , and then , after the second principle , the following : the one that was going to be the best and the way to which I was going to come and have a sense of humor .
I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to be a partner and I &apos;m going to try and get the strength of the life .
And this is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and even the <unk> , and started to explore the more and more and more of the stories .
I was a <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
For the sake of the fact , I had to do the same , and I was able to do it , and it was a strange , very strange , kind of , <unk> , <unk> , and so forth .
The first time we had a few <unk> , as a result , and then they had been added to the very strange , <unk> , <unk> , and the most dramatic , and we were talking about the &quot; &quot; hope &quot; &quot; ?
Can you see the stock of water ?
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that this is the same as the teacher , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s the light that I &apos;m going to say .
In the year , I was not a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I didn &apos;t have the economic growth of the season and the quality of the season .
Two years later , my hand was going to be bad .
I was the only ones who had been to the ground : the clarity of gravity , the familiar , the strange , the number of people .
I had a pneumonia of <unk> , <unk> words , and I had a catalyst for the sex and the sex , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been given a <unk> and <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I was shocked , and the paper was written by a tape tape , and I was able to get it out of the closet , and I &apos;d get to the conclusion that I would get to get to
Now , I &apos;m going to think of the fact that the year I &apos;m going to go through the mountain and hope , and look at the danger of a shit , and I think that &apos;s a lot of time .
And the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and I finally got to the point where I had to get older and then I would have got to be growing up .
My older husband is a <unk> , and I &apos;m just going to get away from them , and I &apos;m not sure that they are helping me to be a very poor and vulnerable person .
I &apos;m struck by the same as the race and the other one , and my collaborator , my collaborator , and my collaborator , and I have been trained to go back to the situation , and I &apos;ve got a lot of my right moments , and I &apos;ve got a short job of my health , but I &apos;ve had a lot of my health care in my life , and I &apos;m not going to be the family .
I think that the <unk> will be able to do this .
If you have a bad time in the middle , it comes out of the line , and when I got older , it &apos;s not just the case that I &apos;m going to go to my husband and my husband and I have to thank the <unk> , and it &apos;s not about me , it &apos;s not going to be a great person to me .
But they were also made in the way that they were in a circle of the right , in the narrow <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know the first time I had been saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never seen a lot of time , and I &apos;ve been a bit of a time when I &apos;m a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been thinking about the problem with the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> problem , and I &apos;ve found that there &apos;s some of the problems with the problem of justice .
For some reason , I was forced to believe that it was difficult to believe , and I was really forced by to believe that I was actually going to be able to read my first self , and I was really my wife .
I was trying to find out that I had to be able to do the same , and the experience of my home , the experience of the experience , the real and the quality of the life that I had , the more I needed to be the victim of the love of living .
I believed in them .
I &apos;m not sure if I can see the fact that I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 60s in the house .
So , I was a little bit like the fact that I had to be a kid in the house , and I was a kid , and I was a little bit like the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and I was a little bit of a mess .
It &apos;s not going to be a place to say .
I have plastic chips ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to have a plastic costume .
And so I realized that the subjects who were looking at promises in the dictionary , I would have been able to raise more risks to the other side of my life , to give them a sense of how much security they would have been , because you knew how to put it in the way we got to the poor , and to give them a sense of what it was like to be a poor and noble cause of faith .
I started with the <unk> , the more recent ones , the more I could get to the point where I started to think , the way we started to get to the finish and the discussion .
I found that all of this in mind that I had to do , and I didn &apos;t want to go to any one of the problems that I didn &apos;t want to solve , <unk> , shame , shame , shame and so forth .
And I was able to understand that this creature was actually a place , and I was able to understand that the greatest thing about this is that it &apos;s the kind of thing that the most important and the most capable are , the things that are the best and the things that are happening .
After that , I had a lot of <unk> , which is the kind of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
After all , 10 years after my father was a <unk> , I had a lot of pressure in the history of the university , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry to be the most burden of the most high school in the history of college .
And I was a <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
I &apos;m also not sure that they &apos;re all in my mind , that they &apos;re not in their own interest .
As a matter of fact , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to be a writer .
We can &apos;t see two languages .
I &apos;ve been working on the scientific issue of living , and I &apos;ve been able to do this , and I &apos;ve been working on the science and the stories of the most important question , and I &apos;ve been working on the same question as the most important question .
I &apos;ve learned to live in the past , and I &apos;ve learned to live in my lifetime , and I &apos;ve tried to live in my life , to be a compassionate , to make sure that it &apos;s not a great deal .
I could help other people who were in the middle of the line , and I could help but get a drink .
Now , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the Indian <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the hard , the hard , the hard , the hard , the success .
It &apos;s a wonderful thing to do with the fact that the customer is going to be a full and important one , and it &apos;s a place where you can actually get a voice and a whole thing .
It &apos;s possible to be able to do this , even to be able to do it .
There &apos;s a word that &apos;s going to be , because if you have a problem , it doesn &apos;t turn into the outcome .
It &apos;s not going to be a record of people .
It doesn &apos;t make any sense to people who are not scared .
I think it &apos;s not that the irony of innovation and the world is not talking about the irony of the creation , but the lack of wisdom and the world is not the creation .
In the last 20 years , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the community , the struggle of entrepreneurship and struggle , the hope that the people who have the privilege of working , the hope that the social progress are going to be the human race .
And as the <unk> said , it &apos;s a <unk> , as a <unk> , to use the potential to use the resources that the human right has to use .
And the biggest way to take care of is that we need to help the people who have the right to help us with the help of the person who have provided the health and the right to help them .
We are the ones and the success , we should have experienced it .
We are not the ones . We are not .
We &apos;re not going to take the thing that &apos;s in our apartment and to be the ones we &apos;re in .
It &apos;s not a light to the light .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about your eyes , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Lord of your mind &quot; &quot; — the way you get to the top .
Let &apos;s talk about the word &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; — the right .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk about my lab .
But what is it that &apos;s going to be ?
Because , of course , you can &apos;t get a picture of this camera , you know .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry to be a <unk> , &quot; &quot; when I got to the first floor .
I was a senior of my experience in the early years of this , but I was also able to use a process of using a kind of a sort of a process of being used to get it out of the camera .
You can see the <unk> picture of the landscape , which is the way you get the finished .
And I was told , you know , the photo was at the right time , right ?
I would think that would be what would happen .
So , I &apos;ve been trying to make something else , and after I &apos;ve done a story , something that starts with a lot of time after it .
And the picture is that the images are in a way to see .
But it &apos;s not just a <unk> game .
And it looks really like that , but it really looks really close .
Or , some of the pictures — a lot of a dark matter , but also a dark , but also in the way that the actual right to be in the actual spot .
And I can &apos;t help but think about the <unk> theory .
Because , of course , this is not what we really can do , but I &apos;ve had a really long time looking at what I &apos;m seeing .
I have to think about some of you who have a little bit of time to help .
So this is actually a question that is really more than just keeping you out of your memory .
And what if it &apos;s the opposite of the reality that it &apos;s going to look like ?
Does it ever have to do with those details ?
Is it that way ?
What is the self-esteem ?
<unk> is the structure of the individual .
But the probe is the way to make it happen , to how it is to make it happen in two <unk> English .
It &apos;s not really what &apos;s really what reality is , what it really looks like .
So , the first thing is simple .
I see this picture of a place where I &apos;m creating a prize , a place where I &apos;ve created a prize , a place where I made a money .
I &apos;m showing you a quick example .
There &apos;s a physical basis that you can imagine in three dimensions here , that three-dimensional <unk> world is about our world .
But it appears that there &apos;s a three-dimensional object that has been , in a way , a <unk> , which is a place that has been possible .
And we know that there isn &apos;t a lot of them .
So we &apos;re playing with our game , because our brain doesn &apos;t know that reality is not the whole thing .
And I see the process of making a process of making the same process as a place .
And this is actually a question of how we &apos;re going to be a different kind of reality .
So the things that we haven &apos;t thought about , I think , the things that we haven &apos;t thought about , is that things are the things that we &apos;ve been thinking about in
And the way to get pictures of the photos is to really understand how it &apos;s going to be , because it seems to be a lot of things .
What I want to say to you is three simple rules that we have to decide to do in order to make a difference .
You see , these images aren &apos;t specific to a particular point .
But in a way , it &apos;s something that happens .
So the first thing that we have to do is to have the same kind of paper that can be used to make a picture of a unified picture .
Secondly , the same light has to be the same light as light .
And that &apos;s two of the two things — the same amount of input and energy .
And third , the image of the person , the one in the middle , is not the kind of thing that &apos;s going to happen to the other end of the another .
It &apos;s not going to be a place where you can &apos;t get the way it &apos;s been done .
We have the same kind of imagery of the fact that the images between the white and the <unk> , the contract , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and so on , and so forth , and there &apos;s a lot of anxiety that &apos;s going to be , and
And this is another one .
( Laughter ) People think it &apos;s a bit of a sense of a combination of the kind of beauty that is being made .
But it &apos;s actually a picture of the fact that it &apos;s OK , it &apos;s a place where you can picture the pictures of gravity .
You &apos;re not asking me to be a place of place , a place where you can &apos;t have a place , you don &apos;t have to be a way to get your ideology .
But it &apos;s really hard to do .
And I knew that I knew that there was a few months of training for the idea of finding the new places of the past , and to find out where I could find the new place .
For example , fish is the <unk> of fish .
They &apos;re all different .
The water is a <unk> in the morning .
And I was also paint in the <unk> , which is the house of the Swedish <unk> , and I was able to see the house .
So , I think that &apos;s going to be a matter of reality , which is that it &apos;s possible to have a conversation with the activity .
Every time a <unk> comes in .
Then you get some of the different pictures .
In this case , it was a very good idea .
And you can see the pictures , the very good , and also the wonderful , but also the <unk> .
So we all have all the theories that we need , and the thing that drives us is the power .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Julian Julian Julia , you &apos;re going to hit it .
So it was a data that , by the way , the whole world of information , the most recent , has been published more than the data that the whole world has published .
Is this possible ?
Julian <unk> : Yes , that &apos;s what it means to be right ?
What if the rest of the world is going to take a lot of bad work to this , and that &apos;s how a small audience is going to be a lot of responsibility for the whole world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people spread these things ?
How do you think the diagnosis of the industrial ?
JA : So , these are the people who are the information that we &apos;ve seen , and they &apos;re different ways to get us to explore .
It &apos;s encrypted that it &apos;s encrypted , and it &apos;s been encrypted to make the Internet , and to make sure that the law is the way to stop , and to prevent the law , it &apos;s also a place to go to the state .
We can have a password of intelligence and we have to stop in the way that we have forgotten , and it &apos;s a little bit of a question — and it &apos;s a little hard to deal with — and it can be a little hard to deal with , and it &apos;s a little hard to use — it &apos;s going to be hard
CA : Well , you know , the majority of us are being treated . You know , you can &apos;t see who &apos;s going to be a good thing .
JA : Right . If we have to know , we &apos;re going to know the evidence that we can &apos;t have the information that you can do .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the CIA , the TED code . ( Laughter )
I want to think about the <unk> of a document .
This is the data from a few years ago .
So let &apos;s think about that .
It was a story from Kenya .
Can you talk about how this story of your experience ?
JA : This is the <unk> <unk> .
It was a survey that was taken by the foreign occupation of the 2004 , which is after the year .
He was in the middle of the year 18 years ago , and he was working with him in 18 years .
He was on the floor .
They &apos;ve taken a lot of the same way that they have to fight for the same as the <unk> , which is that they &apos;re fighting two million pounds of their own .
And the art of the city , and the most <unk> man in Kenya , and he was now using the most <unk> .
It &apos;s like a book of Kenya , as a book .
In 2007 , I had a few years ago , and I knew that I could have done some of the things that were on the floor .
This is a way to think about , new , <unk> , <unk> , and then we published the same thing that three days after the <unk> , and that &apos;s the case after that .
CA : It &apos;s not a long time ago , it &apos;s not a place to say , it &apos;s been called the <unk> , it &apos;s just going to be the result of the kind of news that &apos;s going to change .
JA : Yes . The famous title was , in the name of the British <unk> , in the country , in the country , in the country , in Africa , in Africa , in the country .
The X got the X .
And a few days ago , the news of the news was a very hard writing .
It was published in Kenya , and it was published in Kenya , and the exponential growth of publishing and value in Kenya was that it was able to change the outcome of the number of people .
CA : So how could it change the information you could leak in your world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : And this is the video that &apos;s going on in the air , and it &apos;s got video .
The video is a little too long . It &apos;s a little bit of a picture .
And the first thing that &apos;s happened is that there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of text in this video .
Radio : ... <unk> , if you have a little bit of a time .
Now , the thing is , you know , in my opinion , the <unk> .
Moon . It &apos;s the horse .
It &apos;s like when you see it . It &apos;s like a little bit of time .
He &apos;s hit his tape .
It &apos;s the spread .
( <unk> ) I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not an aunt .
And the hotel , <unk> <unk> , Bush , <unk> , Bush , I &apos;m not sure if you have an answer to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
We needed to have a conversation .
We were killed by eight , we were killed .
We have two <unk> , we &apos;re going to keep it .
It was . It died .
We have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
O . What is it ? What is that ?
<unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
CA : How did that video have become the imagery ?
JA : That &apos;s the kind of heavy people that are in this business .
And this video was sent to two years on the grid .
This is a <unk> from three of the cells .
CA : And I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; Well , if I have to do it , what do you think that &apos;s going to be done ?
JA : Yes . Two of them died , and two kids died .
And in my absence , the man died of the last 18 .
CA : So this is the reason for the whole of the companies .
What was that , that the reason for this , and the reason for the dark matter , was the economy of the destruction of the world ?
JA : I know , I think people have seen the extraordinary amount of the people .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of people who are comfortable with a <unk> — and they &apos;re not — and they &apos;re not just — they &apos;re going to be killed by a <unk> .
There was two <unk> , who had been trained and saw their own job .
CA : The U.S. is the <unk> <unk> , Brad Brad <unk> , who &apos;s been told that the <unk> are already leaked by the video of the <unk> , and the <unk> in the video is the <unk> .
Is that true ?
JA : We &apos;ve been denied these papers .
Five days ago , before the <unk> wrote , it was a <unk> .
This year , the U.S. commercial <unk> , we &apos;ve published the show , but it &apos;s not about cooperation .
I had a journey .
CA : If you were to have the U.S. <unk> , did you mean to have the diplomatic effects of the United States ?
JA : We &apos;re getting them . ( CA : Well , we &apos;ve done this . CA : Yes . ( CA : Well , I &apos;ve done it for the reason : I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;ve been doing it for the whole country , and the people in the country are familiar
And the <unk> are all these kinds of materials .
CA : So , I &apos;m talking about this kind of conversation .
In my tradition , is it possible that it &apos;s a question of ideology ?
What are you doing right now , when you &apos;re a senior , at the end of your book ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a question that the world has to do with the world , which can be completely new from the creation of wisdom .
The numbers are so far too much .
We have the opportunity to be able to do the amazing and good things about the fact that we can &apos;t afford to have a new and good quality of growth , which is the way to do things , to be able to do the way that we can be a new and good for these data
It &apos;s in the center of the ground , it &apos;s a <unk> site , it &apos;s already going to be a <unk> .
CA : But if you don &apos;t have a little bit of trouble , people who don &apos;t have an answer , people can be a little bit of a clue , and they can be a little bit of a mess .
JA : H , in the information we have .
So we have the opportunity to be a subject to the subject .
The theme of all of this is that we &apos;ve been published with the essence of the whole story of the same thing .
There &apos;s a certain set of laws — the names of the word , the laws of defense , the laws of law , the kind of news that we know , the things that you &apos;re doing .
CA : All of you know that they &apos;re good at .
And the one that I had to do in the United States , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the fact that , you know , you &apos;ve done some of the things that you want to draw on ,
And the people who are facing the <unk> of the Mechanical Turk show are following by laughing .
The vast majority of people who are facing this worldwide are not the human sense of the human being . It &apos;s not .
I don &apos;t think my son is . &quot; &quot; Would you like to do that ? &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a kid .
JA : Well , it &apos;s very much like the ones .
But you can &apos;t do it in the context of the <unk> , and the people in the basement , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the day they &apos;re going to see this video .
It &apos;s not that they change their minds , they don &apos;t change the way they feel .
Every day , they see it every day .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done for a fortune of the year , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
CA : So , you know , you can &apos;t have the company that governments and companies have been able to do the way that they can &apos;t .
We &apos;re going to be able to get a lot of it .
But what &apos;s bizarre is that you are not allowed to make the light of themselves , as you can see .
JA : It &apos;s not . It &apos;s not exactly the way it &apos;s going to be .
Or what I have is not the data that &apos;s going to happen .
If they look at these , they can be used for us , and they &apos;re going to be hard for us to try to do things like , we &apos;re trying to get a job to do it , and the guys who are going to work on our work are trying to help us work .
CA : And what do you think I &apos;m talking about , who &apos;s the same as I &apos;m talking about ?
<unk> and Julia have two of those qualities .
One is that it &apos;s a light that &apos;s invisible to the light .
The election is a search for the other .
Who are the things that are going to be ?
What is the driving security ?
JA : Well , it &apos;s a few guy , you know , no .
CA : I mean , this is a lot of people , Julian .
We &apos;re going to have to do a little bit more . Let &apos;s see .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that , in fact , it &apos;s going to be published at TED .
Is it a strange thing that &apos;s happened in those places ?
What do you think ?
JA : That &apos;s what we see every day .
The last time the late <unk> , in the <unk> , was announced in the Gulf of Mexico , although it &apos;s not powerful .
We had this kind of model of the opportunity to do a similar thing , which is to do the way that the organizations of the Royal Society of the Royal Society of the Royal Society .
And the idea of the obesity government and other of the others .
And the reason for the interview was that it was not a single thing . It was a little hard to say .
We didn &apos;t know what it was , and we didn &apos;t know what was happening in the bar .
We had a little bit of a bit of a genius , a game that would be a game of mine .
And so , you can see , you know , we &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re just a little bit of a genius , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of a bit of it .
We don &apos;t know how to do it .
Well , you know , we &apos;re not going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be able to get the evidence for the past , but we can &apos;t see the evidence . &quot; &quot; And we took this journey from the company to the <unk> , and we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to have to believe that
You talk about the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in my mind .
Now , what is the core of the laws ?
You can &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you can &apos;t have a look at the ocean , and you &apos;re going to have a conversation with the fact that you can &apos;t see the owner .
It &apos;s the same .
( Applause ) And the more things we have to do .
One of the ways that I &apos;m going to use a laser is to write a <unk> letter to a <unk> .
CA : So , you have to have a <unk> .
JA : Yes , it &apos;s also , you know , it &apos;s a lot of fun , and it &apos;s the kind of thing that you &apos;re going to do with the time you &apos;re going to work with your own .
We have the ability to make sure that we can &apos;t do the last few months of the past , but to do the fact that we have a few months of looking at the problems of creating the drugs .
It &apos;s a little problem .
We have a lot of responsibility to be in new new conditions , as we &apos;ve got to say , to be a very important institution , but also to the extent that we have a lot of information , and we have no workers .
CA : What do you have to do to make sure that you have to do with the <unk> of the Royal <unk> , the <unk> ?
JA : Yeah . We &apos;re the people who we believe .
It &apos;s hard to have a sense of growth in a way that &apos;s not just a place in our hands , but it &apos;s also a lot of hard people to be able to get in the presence of the activity of the people who are in the presence of
CA : So , can you say , you can &apos;t do this ?
I &apos;ve read in the literature that I have in the room , in the same way that I can change the school .
Is that the right thing ?
JA : I was a movie , a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : The <unk> , the <unk> , they said , &quot; &quot; All right , I &apos;m going to have to say , &quot; &quot; I had to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot;
JA : Where do you keep the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : I mean , you know , you know , when I was a kid , you would have been in the audience , and I would have the answer to the problem .
JA : I was a prisoner .
I was one of the <unk> reviews .
I was in the spring of the last year when I was a kid .
We need to act with a minimum of a <unk> .
You can make things with the way that you can make the road .
And the irony of the <unk> , which is the amount of <unk> that &apos;s happening for the most part , is that it &apos;s been a little bit like a pit of the bank .
It &apos;s not like a movie before .
CA : And I think you &apos;ve got to think that the amount of time that you &apos;re supposed to do , you &apos;ve got to be able to get the money out of your body , and what &apos;s the key ?
You can tell them about the data , or you can tell them about them , or do they want to talk about their events ?
JA : H .
But I can also believe that people are creating structures , and people are creating structures .
I was not going to be able to learn from people like my father , I &apos;m not going to learn how to live with the <unk> people .
CA : <unk> , <unk> human <unk> , who is fighting them ?
JA : I &apos;m a few naive people , I &apos;m not listening to them , I &apos;m not going to demonstrate the way that they &apos;re going to be , but in the way — I can &apos;t tell you — but in the way that they &apos;re going to
And this is the <unk> I &apos;ve been for for a long time .
CA : Have you ever stared at the last couple of minutes , but you can &apos;t tell what &apos;s happened in the last few minutes ?
And the problem with you is that the bank is the problem , and the news has been given a lot of the spread of the data that it &apos;s going to spread .
And it was a lot of fun .
You &apos;ve done good in the same time . Then what happened ?
JA : That &apos;s the big .
It was in the study of economics .
It was one of the largest <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was 10 times more than the other .
We published this information in the last year .
The term of the school is that , in the village , it &apos;s almost five years ago , and as the movie said , the news was five years ago , and the reason for the movie was to go out and see what it would have been like .
We published the news of the X app and the community , and we talked about the story , and we talked about it .
The opportunity to get to the state of the state , however , is to give a sense of what this is , and after a few of the successes , the president of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world
And the other one knew that the country was going to be habitable in the way that they were in Norwegian countries .
And so , before we got to the <unk> , we had to be in the <unk> of the so-called
CA : I &apos;m going to say that .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s take a shower , Julian , <unk> , and I &apos;m going to try to make it happen .
If you think about the question , what do you believe in , if anything , everything else is going to be , if anything , it &apos;s going to be a good thing , and people will be like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure why it is .
It &apos;s a place in the world , and it &apos;s in the United States and the United States and the <unk> of the United States .
It &apos;s hard to see how the future is going to be .
It &apos;s a very interesting thing that we &apos;re living in , and we can change what &apos;s going on .
CA : What do you mean to know what our secular names of hearing , Julian , is being <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thanks . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to read .
I &apos;m a workaholic and I &apos;m not going to talk about the literature , and I &apos;m going to talk about the story of the story , and I &apos;m just talking about the lack of terror .
But let me just talk about this as a story , which is the story of the story .
I &apos;m going to use words as a way of saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;ll have a few of them in the middle of a few apartments .
I &apos;m not in the same way as a family , in the French .
And I &apos;m going to be a victim of the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a journalist , and I &apos;m going to turn my mother .
I &apos;ve been in bed with a child &apos;s kid in the middle of the time .
It was a very strange idea of understanding , in the 1970s .
I was the family of the family family , who was a family of a family , who was a family , who was a member of the family , who was a teenager .
I was in the middle of the two brothers , and I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s going on .
I was a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And then , in the same way that I spent the rest of the time , I was always thinking about , less , less <unk> , less <unk> .
And so , I was like , you know , the one that I &apos;m going to do is just like a little bit of a rock , and you have a little bit of a mess to the devil .
The fact that the leak was going to be the same as the people who had taken off the inside of the past .
And yet , what happened with the same time , the reason for me , was that it was a <unk> , a <unk> , that I would have been talking about , and I would have been talking about the number of girls in the middle of the room .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s going to be a lot of <unk> .
After a week , he was a little bit of a guy .
I know that I can &apos;t talk to the story of a lot of people , and I don &apos;t think that people who have been left to say that they &apos;re not going to be a happy one , but I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s a lot of other people or some other person who &apos;s left to say that they &apos;re not going to be a <unk> or a <unk> .
I asked the woman how I was going . That was the power of the button .
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , you have the gift , the <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of hope . &quot; &quot; And then , in the study , we have to go to the class , and if you want to go to a story , you want to go to the ground , and you want to be a person , or a soul ,
It &apos;s the <unk> .
All of us are in the era of the social and <unk> .
We &apos;re all in the way .
We &apos;re born with a lot of our ability to think of , like , a <unk> , a <unk> .
But if you don &apos;t know that we have a living in the world , we &apos;re going to lose the risk of spreading the Earth through the outside , and you &apos;re going to be able to see it from the inside .
We can still have a free power , we can &apos;t have any sense of our childhood , we can see that we &apos;re going to have a lot of time in the way that we &apos;re in the region .
Our neighbors , our <unk> , our way of being a family , our way to our family , and our desire to do , is to remind us of ourselves as well .
And as I &apos;m saying , women are saying something like this , and they &apos;re putting it into the top of the day , and they &apos;re putting it into the top of the day , or the <unk> of the day , or the <unk> of the cup .
It &apos;s not the belief that it has been in the presence of a situation , it &apos;s not solid , it &apos;s not a lot of the human being .
And it &apos;s one of the largest trends that we have , and it &apos;s one of the greatest benefits of our global workforce that we have to share with .
And it &apos;s all over the place , liberals and sisters , between liberals and liberals , and the people , in the middle , are in the middle and the right .
We have to start with the problems of the dinosaurs and the things that are necessary and the title of the world .
And the idea is that the artist has been the kind of challenge that I think has been going on in the past .
And the way to get the strings to the masses is to open up the grid in the ground .
And as we see these things , we can also , you know , we can love what we see .
I started writing stories from eight years old .
My mother said to me , &quot; &quot; My father said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a story , and my story is going to be good for the rest of the world .
Now I think that that year , that I think that &apos;s a very brief idea .
My late friends , I was a teenager , but I was not supposed to be my friends to my friends , and I was not supposed to be very happy to my teacher .
I was a kid , and I was a <unk> kid who was a <unk> kid , and I was a <unk> kid , and I was a <unk> kid , and I was a kid .
But he didn &apos;t know that I was going to be a very good idea , and I was going to have to think about my life as a matter of fact , that I was going to be a bit of a <unk> .
I started writing about the things that didn &apos;t work , and I started writing about the things that weren &apos;t about it .
I started to get my other quiet love for my own love .
The first thing that happened to me was that the more people had been given a <unk> , the other story , was the stories of other parts .
And so , notice that I &apos;m going to be a little bit of my life , that &apos;s the kind of thing that I &apos;m trying to do .
And this is a kind of thing that we had .
And the first one was also a diplomat .
I was also reminded of the landscape , which is the kind of <unk> , the middle of the middle , and I was in the middle of the study , and I was kind of the kind of species in the middle of the year .
The first time I was told , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what the typical government is , &quot; &quot; I was the kid who was in charge of all the nationalism that I had in the village , but it was a lot of the time that it was necessary for the discussion .
As you know , these kids , they &apos;re not allowed to be able to use themselves to their own , but they &apos;re not allowed to be treated as more of a greater <unk> .
We look like a lot of the people in the world , and it &apos;s fun , it &apos;s a little fun , it &apos;s a bad thing to do , and it &apos;s just a matter of the audience .
And when he was growing up , he was always frustrated , and he was always frustrated .
And I was very familiar with this , and I was shocked , in the English community , and the <unk> music , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) I was a kid who was a middle-class kid who was a middle-class kid .
And the first time I saw this , I saw the concept of the comic culture .
I asked all of the kids , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; They asked me to give a few pictures of what I had been a couple of years ago , and they asked them to do all the versions of the whole experience .
I learned that there was a 3D stress experience , and that was the story of the world , and it was the story of the world .
From Spain after Spain , we went to the Germans and we found out about the new .
I found out that my journey and my imagination were the fourth minimum , and I had to think about the journey of my own journey .
The amazing things that I have to say about the fact that I &apos;m not feeling the feeling of clarity and strength and strength — that &apos;s the moment when I &apos;m talking about it .
I was a <unk> , I was in my 20s .
I was living in a living environment , and I was living in a living room .
I was there in the middle of 1999 , and I was there .
I was the one that I started with when I was a writer , which was the first time I saw the scene .
He was a <unk> , a old salesman , a <unk> , <unk> , and the father of the street , and the man who was talking about the living .
The long on the back , the <unk> , the <unk> , was sitting still with the rest of the eye .
I saw the <unk> of the <unk> of the Royal Society of the Royal Society of the Royal Society of the Royal Society of the Royal Society — the one that I had to call the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when we have the dates and the dates of the mountain , we &apos;ll be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit like this .
I believe that I believe that there is a competition for the story .
I don &apos;t think that you should be a strong , spiritual thing , but you can &apos;t read a good relationship with it , and we don &apos;t have to go back to the very same room , and we know that we don &apos;t have the same way that we don &apos;t have to be
After I was a child , I went to the Boston School , and I went to the school , and then I went to the school .
It &apos;s not just about foreign excitement , it &apos;s actually completely changed .
I started with my English .
I &apos;m a genius , and I &apos;m not sure whether my English is going to be my English , because they &apos;re helping me to change my English language .
I love the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and I love my characters and the more it happens . I love my writing , and I want to be more mathematical .
I think I &apos;m connected to every language .
I &apos;ve been learning that in the U.K. , as millions of people around the world are told , &quot; &quot; English language . &quot; &quot; English language is language .
When you learn language , you have to learn to learn , you know , the way we learn .
As we later , more and more , and more , and more promises , more and more things are going to be better , because we talk about our brains and our brain .
This is a <unk> .
But I can &apos;t tell you , I can &apos;t tell you that , I can be pulled out of this .
I was in the Boston class of my school , and I was a <unk> .
I could have spent the day trying to get my life on the day after day to my day , and I would have been able to get the rest of my life on the day before I was going to be a place , and I could be a place where I could be in the middle of the day .
I was living in a family of family , and I was able to get to the family .
( Laughter ) But I went to the pharmacy , and I went to the <unk> .
And I started to get stuck between the U.S. and the <unk> , and I couldn &apos;t see the other two worlds around the world .
I &apos;m a part of my part of the physical and physical , physical , physical .
I think my stories are always the ones that I have to get and I can &apos;t get my stories .
I believe that when you &apos;re in the real world , you can actually read the magic of that thing , and when you &apos;re really in the shoes of the story , it &apos;s actually a lot of awareness .
I &apos;d like to just leave you with this idea of this .
One of the things I wrote in the English was that when you saw the light from the United States , it was a place called the <unk> .
&quot; &quot; The book has been to love . &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to have a little bit of text written . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to the point where I wanted to be .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you look at the situation , you have the name of the Native Americans , the American , the <unk> , the <unk> , the guy who &apos;s the one . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s the same thing that the university did in the Boston camp , and I think that the more we should be able to do more than the other , the more I wanted to know what
But I know it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a genius .
He wanted to make my grandfather a <unk> .
He wanted me to be a kind of a kind of <unk> , which I was kind of like to call the <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about the world &apos;s history of the world , and we &apos;re talking about the world , and it &apos;s not the way to deal with the culture of politics , and we can see that it &apos;s not going to be hurt .
The authors of the scientists don &apos;t have to be very familiar with the fact that they don &apos;t have a lot of , but they don &apos;t have to do it .
If you &apos;re female , if you &apos;re a member of the Muslim world , you can &apos;t afford to be a woman who &apos;s talking to the Islam , and that &apos;s the woman who &apos;s not a woman .
And the more <unk> , the more <unk> , the more <unk> , the more you can be out of the closet .
In the world of matter , I have been involved in the world .
It &apos;s not like the creative people who have ideas , the arts , the countries , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the one that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , a few , a half a gallon .
It &apos;s not the fault of our own , the eye is the way we are .
In the case of the year , when he took a letter and published the picture , he asked him about a question about homosexuality , and he asked him about the sex .
And the argument that I had to do was stand up and stood on the front board , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t see anything else , and I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; you know , you don &apos;t have anything to do with other people , and I think it &apos;s the same as the other people who have been in the middle of the Internet .
It &apos;s a wonderful opportunity to be a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about the first ever since I was a teenager , who &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m very sure that I &apos;m in my life .
We were writing three letters , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
( Laughter ) And the reason we got together was , in fact , the one that we had to do .
We were alone .
They &apos;re looking at the actual stories of writing , which is the case of other people who are in other places .
It &apos;s a <unk> in the back .
They &apos;re not only <unk> , but they &apos;re also <unk> , and they &apos;re more like a <unk> .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the story of the story , but it &apos;s not about it .
It &apos;s the whole world .
I found this in the first year of the year in 2005 , and I saw it in 2005 .
I work in the study of the women , and I &apos;m going to write a lot of advice to the patient , and I &apos;m going to be a very poor person .
When I was a teenager , I was raised as big as the big , big , big , big , big , big , big thing .
So , I had to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a conversation with the word &quot; &quot; — the <unk> , the <unk> , and the other .
But I would like to say that I would have to say , I &apos;m going to be two , and that &apos;s a period of time .
It &apos;s a story .
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do I want to do when I say &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; ?
I &apos;m going to try to figure out how to deal with the experience of life , and I &apos;m just going to try and do it .
They &apos;re not the language of politics , but the political books are also worth the political books , not the language of politics , but the language of the conversation .
And the way that we put together is that the Web is the only way of solving and finding the problems of the problem .
And the two things that you can do is to do it . &quot; &quot; And the political divide is spreading us apart .
One is that they &apos;re telling us the things that are going to make it .
And they &apos;re really curious about the other .
It &apos;s a border of a border .
The other is the way to do it .
The politics is a flat .
And then there &apos;s a lot of it .
They had heard of a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; They had to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and they had to tell stories , and they had to tell stories , and they had to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and they had to go to the <unk> .
They change the way they do , the way to make the crossing grow .
And he would listen to him , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , people don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> , the <unk> .
The Greeks were familiar with the fact that the United States , the United States , was like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Africa , &quot; &quot; as the <unk> of the United States , the <unk> and the <unk> .
And the stories that are going to be today are now improving the stories .
They listen to the Palestinian and violent politicians , the social justice of Israel , who are passionate about the social justice press that are being fought to the brave , and the stories are being connected .
And the skill of our lives is going to be more .
If you don &apos;t , it &apos;s not a good thing , it &apos;s not a good reason .
I &apos;m going to tell you the book that &apos;s going to be a few weeks for me , and it &apos;s a shame that &apos;s a shame .
But there &apos;s a lot of the science that &apos;s going to be in the world .
And after the studio and the <unk> of the spirit , the <unk> of the <unk> , the first operating , the book of the first operating room , had to be able to print the book in the water .
As we can see , we know that if you don &apos;t know that , you know , we don &apos;t know about the problem , the fear is more than the way that we can &apos;t go , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s more than a <unk> . &quot; &quot; We know that we don &apos;t know about the problem of being a problem , and
There &apos;s no such thing as love : we don &apos;t live in the way .
It &apos;s one of the things that &apos;s been constant .
The irony is that it &apos;s always a permanent reality .
I &apos;m also the ones that I have .
The idea that I wrote with the <unk> of the book , the <unk> , the <unk> , the world , the world &apos;s creation , the world &apos;s disease .
I believe that I believe that this is a place where I believe it is a place to live , and it &apos;s also a place where it &apos;s all about to be anywhere .
Your crew has been to see the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
The death gap in the audience is a place called the <unk> , which is the place to see the Middle East .
It &apos;s the place where the buildings are .
And that &apos;s not going to be very much like me .
We believe that what we believe is that we can &apos;t believe the world is .
We have found that there &apos;s a fundamental number of examples of the importance of being diagnosed with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And I think that the irony of the culture is that you have to be the kind of media .
I &apos;m going to give you a very supportive of the kind of love and a lot of wisdom .
I love you to think about 10 weeks before .
I love my wish to my surprise .
I can write a call for a woman in a couple of years . And I &apos;ll be a happy woman , and I can have a happy blue professor in the next year .
We can just write out the whole thing .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , I think the <unk> said , &quot; &quot; I think the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m told , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m feeling &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s
And I don &apos;t think , well , we don &apos;t know why , and we don &apos;t have to write a lot of things to know the students in the literature .
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for you .
What we know is that we don &apos;t know who we are , and how we know about how we &apos;re not going to know what &apos;s the whole story .
We don &apos;t have to experience the word and we don &apos;t have to teach each other .
We need to know the past , the other world , to the other world .
And the way to draw those apartments is to be a <unk> .
And it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t have the same situation , they put together a whole range of things . And that &apos;s good news .
I said , &quot; &quot; I want to meet the way I can finish the water , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You can meet the way things look like , the love world is going to be . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
And the big idea of being in the world is that it &apos;s a tiny idea to be a big ideological story .
I &apos;m going to be able to play this little idea .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The women who are called the A group of women who are now called <unk> .
And they &apos;re women .
I was reminded of the hard value of the matter .
I had a few more years from about two years ago .
My success was going to be a <unk> , my heart , and I was shot on the right , right .
I started to understand the way the word could be .
I was a research , I was a teenager , I was consulting , and I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make it a lot more like a <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be normal .
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to be able to do this , we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
We &apos;re going to be the most famous thing in the world .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very clear , it &apos;s a little bit of a matter of having a little bit of quiet .
And when he was a kid , he had to talk about the year before , and he was going to talk about four or four hours before he was in the middle of the night .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that you are going to be a <unk> .
What &apos;s more interesting about the five hours of the sky ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a lot less of a matter of men .
I think , &quot; &quot; What is eight about this ? &quot; &quot; And if you do , it &apos;s about eight years ago , and it said , &quot; &quot; How do you do that in the last eight years ? &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , there &apos;s a lot of fun , but you can &apos;t have a few places , and you can &apos;t tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about this , and I &apos;ve been thinking about , &quot; &quot; and we &apos;ve got to do it , and we &apos;ve got to do it , but it &apos;s not , because it &apos;s
You can &apos;t have a lot of attention to the people who are going to be a <unk> .
It &apos;s not about the fact that it &apos;s not a good leader , it &apos;s a good leader , it &apos;s a great leader .
And the months of the Titanic , we have to be able to do it .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that the big deal with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you know , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
( Applause ) The <unk> spent seven hours a day , or seven hours a night , maybe a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and maybe even seven years of a time .
And it &apos;s a really good idea that we have been able to do our best , which is that we don &apos;t have to be the kind of life that we have in our lives , that we &apos;re not supposed to be living in our life , and that is the best that we have .
And then you have to see , in fact , the power to see the big ideological ideological , the power of the devices , the power of the structure .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And I think that the brain is going to be the case to the brain .
What &apos;s the problem ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
&quot; &quot; What do you think we &apos;re talking about are people who are not acting in the brain ?
I was able to do that in my mind that I had a disease .
I was like , you know , my grandfather , I was like , you know , I &apos;m going to be a kid .
You can &apos;t see the brain , the brain is two of the two segments .
And the future is the future of the future .
Now , the right example is a lot of the energy that we have .
It &apos;s a lot of people who are in the middle of the same thing .
We can &apos;t see things like , you know , we &apos;re going to be doing things like this , and we &apos;re going to have a different kind of life .
Let me give you a few more . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
The right brain is actually moving through the way we think of the way we &apos;re seeing the way we &apos;re going to do .
The energy that &apos;s going to look at is how it &apos;s actually becoming , in fact , how it &apos;s going to look like the current moment , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s used , how it &apos;s felt , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s made , how it &apos;s being made , how it &apos;s felt , how it feels , how it &apos;s feeling , how it &apos;s going to be
We have the right brain , the potential to be the energy of the brain with the Web system .
And this is the case , the wrong , and the eye .
The left is a place to be a <unk> , a place to be completed .
We think the left hemisphere is going to be a broken .
The left is a <unk> , which is the kind of wisdom that he &apos;s going to take on his head .
And the left is the way to think about the language .
It &apos;s a <unk> world , and it &apos;s a world that is free to our world .
This is the voice that we put in the house : &quot; &quot; When you get to the house , you must have been a <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s not that we have to do it .
I started to work on my work , and I started to shake .
The idea that we can — I think that &apos;s the creation of the creation of creativity — that it &apos;s the creation of the creation of the creation , and the idea is that it &apos;s not about the reality that &apos;s going to be a lot of the world .
You can see that my body is going to slow down .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of the way we can try to bring a shower to the showers .
I was the one who was a member of the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; by the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to be a real , <unk> , <unk> structure of the molecules .
The one thing that I knew was that the amount of space — the sense of power .
What if I had seen the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
I &apos;m all my staff , and I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that I &apos;m not going to be a writer .
And you can see the y <unk> .
And you can see that you are less than a little .
It was the watch .
And the next thing is that the left brain is coming back .
And I &apos;m going to say that right now , right now , I &apos;m going to be right now .
And the brain is &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; !
( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t have a lot of talk to you ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You don &apos;t have a lot of fun . &quot;
I have to say , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m trying to be a <unk> .
And I went back to the front , and I got to come back to the point where I could go back to the rest of my projects .
So I &apos;m struck by the phone , and I &apos;m a <unk> , and I &apos;m a geek .
I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you my humor , my life .
And my brain , I &apos;m a teenager , and I &apos;m a <unk> .
How do we think about how we can do it , how much it is that it &apos;s great ?
And I &apos;m going to have to be <unk> , just by the time I &apos;m growing up .
We &apos;re going to choose the right brain .
